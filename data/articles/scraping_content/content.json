      "The movie amassed $92.8 million during its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, making it the highest-grossing domestic concert film ever, according to Box Office Mojo, which tracks box office earnings. That means it surpassed the $73 million run of \u201cJustin Bieber: Never Say Never\u201d in 2011.",
      "Fans flocked to theaters during the weekend ready to live \u2014 or relive \u2014 the almost three-hour concert experience, picking up Eras Tour popcorn buckets and trading friendship bracelets with strangers. Many decked out in themed outfits ranging from casual merch to full-out bedazzled bodysuits.",
      "Viewers shared videos on social media of their fellow attendees screaming, dancing and waving along to Swift\u2019s lyrics. A crowd often massed at the front of the theater, standing as if they had floor seats at the Eras Tour. One viewer witnessed the film turn into a dance party for a theater full of young children.",
      "Some also commented that they were able to hear the singing even as they sat watching \u201cThe Nun II\u201d or \u201cThe Exorcist: Believer\u201d in another theater \u2014 infusing truth into a long-running joke that emerged almost as soon as Swift announced the film\u2019s release.",
      "The hype was so intense in many theaters that some filmgoers appeared put off by disruptive behavior, sharing in posts online that they felt audience members drowned out Swift\u2019s voice and shined flashlights that obstructed the screen.",
      "Still, many others pointed out that Swift had encouraged treating the film like a concert.",
      "Distributor AMC Theatres had also encouraged dancing and singing at the show, although its guidelines for the film asked attendees not to dance on seats or block others\u2019 view.",
      "Eli Countryman, 25, went to see the concert film two nights in a row upon its release in theaters. He attended opening night at the Grove mall Thursday in Los Angeles, less than 24 hours after Swift had walked the red carpet there at the film\u2019s premiere.",
      "\u201cI spend all my money on Taylor Swift anyways,\u201d he said, three friendship bracelets on his wrist. \u201cI\u2019m excited because we\u2019re going to one of the bigger screenings just to see it in HD.\u201d",

And speaking of queer anthems, Troye Sivan got his first ever nod for the single, \u201cRush,\u201d a beloved internet phenomenon.

Four of the five nominees in the category received their first-ever nominations: Asake, Davido, Ayra Starr, and Tyla. Burna Boy won his first Grammy for his album \u201cTwice As Tall\u201d in the Global Music Album category back in 2021 and has six nominations under his belt. One of the most exciting nominations is Tyla\u2019s song, \u201cWater.\u201d When Tyla spoke with TIME last month, her song was at its peak in popularity. The catchy song found an audience across social media because of its intricate blend of amapiano, afrobeats, pop, and R&B.

      "After trying to dodge jet-tracking accounts for the better part of a year and even forcing the college student who tracks his jets to stop sharing live data on Twitter, Elon Musk appears to have stopped taking advantage of a federal program designed to help camouflage his air travels.",
      "The Tesla CEO had signed up for a free Federal Aviation Administration program that allows private jet owners to fly incognito using a temporary aircraft registration number in January of 2022, but Musk hasn't used the program since August 20, 2022, according to the aircraft-tracking company JetSpy.",
      "Musk applied for a new aircraft registration number four times, JetSpy told Insider. The first time the billionaire's aircraft used the FAA's privacy ICAO aircraft address program, also known as PIA, was on January 25, 2022, but less than eight months later he applied for his last PIA and only used the temporary aircraft registration number for one flight before returning to his permanent ICAO address, according to JetSpy data.",
      "Musk did not respond to Insider's request for comment ahead of publication.",
      "Musk's jet travels first came into the spotlight when University of Central Florida college student Jack Sweeney began posting the billionaire's travel coordinates on social media to thousands of followers.",
      "Sweeney told Insider he's not convinced Musk has entirely given up on avoiding jet-tracking accounts like @ElonJet. For instance, the billionaire's jets are still registered on the FAA's \"Limiting Aircraft Data Displayed\" program, or LADD. The list only requires a one-time registration and prevents flight data from being shown on flight-tracking websites like FlightAware or FlightRadar24 that use FAA data, but they will still show up on websites like JetSpy that use a network of independent radios to detect aircraft.",
      "\"For the PIA, it's probably just a huge logistical problem, planes aren't really designed for you to be changing your code all the time,\" Sweeney said. \"It's kind of confusing. He really made such a big deal about being tracked. If I were him, I'd say 'Why not at least try to keep up with it.\"",
      "The FAA launched the PIA program\u00a0in 2019 and has issued 390 alternate ID codes since the program began, an FAA spokesperson told Insider.",
      "On Wednesday, Forbes reported, citing JetSpy data, that the PIA program has been used to disguise the travels of 48 private jets this year, including the private planes of big names like Jeff Bezos and Taylor Swift.",
      "Musk's vocal disdain for jet-tracking dates back to 2021 when he offered Sweeney $5,000 to take down his @ElonJet account, but the college student offered him some advice instead \u2014 sign up for the FAA's PIA program. Musk used his first alternate ID through the PIA program about a month later.",
      "The PIA program allows aircraft owners to switch out their registration number every 20 days, according to the FAA, but, it can be a laborious process. Christian Renneissen, Collins Aerospace's manager for flight deck connectivity,\u00a0previously told the trade publication AV Buyer that while the PIA program is essentially free, it's a hassle due to a substantial amount of paperwork. What's more, the entire process would have to start all over again if the new registration number is exposed and tied to the owner \u2014 which, in Musk's case, can be all too easy.",
      "Sweeney told Insider that Musk's Gulfstream can be identified by its frequent trips between airports near SpaceX's launch site in Texas and its headquarters in California.",
      "\"It's pretty easy to spot when you can link Brownsville and Hawthorne together,\" he said.",
      "Planes are also required to ditch the PIA for their permanently assigned ICAO address when they fly internationally, which could be an issue for Musk, who visited Shanghai and Rome earlier in 2023.",
      "The incognito registration number also doesn't prevent Sweeney from tracking the private jet via ADS-B Exchange, a public flight-tracking database.",
      "The FAA acknowledged during a conference last year that the program is not a \"silver bullet\" solution to jet-tracking.",
      "\"The PIA program limits the ability to identify an aircraft in real-time using inexpensive, commercially available receivers,\" an FAA spokesperson told Insider. \"This does not prevent parties from using alternative methods (plane spotting, movement correlations, etc.) to identify PIA participants.\"",

      "Heads-up, we\u2019re currently living in \u201cthe least innovative, least transformative, least pioneering century for culture since the invention of the printing press.\u201d So says New York Times art critic Jason Farago in an essay published this month, arguing that the orderly forward thrust of modernism has finally flamed out in 2023, and that our \u201cpresent state of culture feels directionless,\u201d like \u201csome glacially slow Ferris wheel, cycling through remakes and pastiches with nowhere to go but around.\u201d",
      "To illustrate this whirly inertia, Farago points toward pop music more than any other discipline \u2014 which is good, because popular song has probably been our most reliable cultural time stamp for roughly 75 years; but it\u2019s also bad because Farago\u2019s essay seems to be arguing that Moby was more innovative than Chief Keef, and that Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cWe Belong Together\u201d sounds contemporary, and that Amy Winehouse\u2019s very retro \u201cBack to Black\u201d album was \u201cneither new nor retro,\u201d among other beliefs that appear to originate from a state of mind that might not want to understand Lana Del Rey or Playboi Carti.",
      "That said, his fundamental assertion is solid. The familiar, linear march of artistic progress has been twisted, tangled, broken and rerouted by the information age \u2014 and it won\u2019t be straightening itself out anytime soon. Life on this splintered digital plane means that our smartphones can spit the entire history of human art in our faces, and with no more monocultural apparatus (MTV, Clear Channel) to keep everything in order. But why isn\u2019t that something to be excited about? What if, instead of neat links in a corpo-mediated chain, artistic progress is now something growing wild and omnidirectional in the compost pile of history? It would mean that 21st-century critics hoping to serve their moment need to get their hands dirty. Even if they work at the New York Times.",
      "Some of the finest, most filthy-handed music writing being published right now appears on the editorial pages of Bandcamp, the artist-friendly, community-minded music streaming platform, which made news this week for having laid off roughly half of its workforce. For years, the site\u2019s Bandcamp Daily page has offered rich, informative dives into unknown names, unheard sounds, unrecognized styles, forgotten scenes and underloved freak stuff of all stripes. With every other music media outlet perpetually acquiescing to the whims of the algorithm, Bandcamp has never had to waste a keystroke on Taylor Swift or Drake.",
      "It doesn\u2019t hurt that its editorial staff is sitting on the compost pile, either. Over the past decade, Bandcamp has grown into an unfathomably deep library of otherground music, allowing artists anywhere on the planet to upload and sell their songs at prices they see fit. All the while, Bandcamp has managed to pay these artists at much higher rates than the other leading platforms. (Disclosure-slash-testimony: The bands I\u2019ve played in have made our music available on Bandcamp, and my personal experience corresponds with the happy hype \u2014 the pie slices are bigger, and you\u2019re put in direct communication with your listeners.)",
      "So while Bandcamp\u2019s reputation as a site remains one of genuine communion between artists and audiences, its reputation as a business has taken a bleak twist. Epic Games, the video game development company behind Fortnite, purchased Bandcamp in 2022, only to sell it last month to Songtradr, a music licensing company that, this week, chopped Bandcamp\u2019s staff in half, including two of five editorial positions, according to Philip Sherburne\u2019s reporting for Pitchfork.",
      "Sharp. Witty. Thoughtful. Sign up for the Style Memo newsletter.",
      "The outcry on social media this week has been loud and pained. First, there\u2019s the fear that an uncaring new ownership might end up sending one of the world\u2019s most vital music libraries down the digital flush hole. Then there\u2019s the concurrent fear that the community surrounding this special ecosystem will erode and go poof.",
      "The third fear is that there will be one less place in this world for Bandcamp\u2019s incredibly rare mode of music writing \u2014 the kind where staffers, columnists and freelancers actually get paid to tell you everything they know about the latest in vaporwave, dungeon synth or Indonesian indie-pop, rather than whatever\u2019s being sold by pop\u2019s starriest one percent. Bandcamp is one of the only sites around willing to walk you through the dense history of Algerian ra\u00ef music or the desolate compositions of \u00c9liane Radigue. Earlier this year, it was literally the only site where I was able to find a substantive interview with my favorite new jazz singer, Enji.",
      "The future is obviously unwritten here, but as bad omens go, Songtradr\u2019s reflexive gutting of Bandcamp feels both ominous and infuriating \u2014 the latest episode from a chaotic mediascape where moneyed management makes bad decisions, then workers pay with their livelihoods. For Bandcamp\u2019s users, there\u2019s a sour sense that Songtradr has no idea how precious its new acquisition is or, worse, that it doesn\u2019t care. Remember: This is a robust, teeming music platform that grants musicians of any background the power to present and distribute their art. It\u2019s a mistake to understand it only as a spreadsheet.",
      "Yet, above all \u2014 and for now \u2014 Bandcamp stands as exhilarating proof that today\u2019s music is a living thing. Don\u2019t let anyone try to convince you that our culture is no longer breathing when unchecked capitalism is still doing everything in its power to choke it out."

      "Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has been taking his play to a new level whenever Taylor Swift is in the house",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- This season of the Kansas City Chiefs might someday be remembered for two distinct eras: pre-Taylor and post-Taylor.",
      "Travis Kelce's season certainly will be.",
      "Whether coincidence or fate or a function of true love, the Chiefs tight end has been on a tear since his overtures toward pop superstar Taylor Swift resulted in a newfound relationship. Kelce was out with a hyperextended knee in Week 1, when the Chiefs lost to the Lions, and had four catches for 26 yards in his return against the Jaguars. But in the six games since Swift first watched Kelce play, he's caught 48 passes for 499 yards and four touchdowns.",
      "That includes a 12-catch performance for 179 yards and a score in a 31-17 win over the Chargers on Sunday, when Swift was back in an Arrowhead Stadium suite and chest-bumping Brittany Mahomes, wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.",
      "In the four games Swift has attended, Kelce has averaged 108 yards receiving. He averaged 46.5 in the two games she did not.",
      "That led Chiefs coach Andy Reid to say: \u201cTaylor can stay around as long as she want.\u201d",
      "He wasn't joking, either. She might be Kelce's good-luck charm.",
      "Or maybe he's just defying logic by getting better with age.",
      "Even though he turned 34 earlier this month, the same age as retired tight end Rob Gronkowski, Kelce continues to make plays that leave everyone wondering just how he did that. Take his game against the Chargers, a division rival that has seen him plenty of times yet was powerless to prevent him from finding open nooks and crannies in their defense.",
      "In one case, Kelce found a yawning chasm and ran 54 yards before he was finally brought down by the Chargers.",
      "\u201cThe younger Trav would have scored on that one,\u201d Mahomes said with a smile, \u201cI'll say that.\u201d",
      "He might not have been that open, though. Mahomes said the biggest difference in the 34-year-old Kelce from the one who broke into the league a decade ago is his ability to diagnose what the defense is doing, then quickly find a way to counteract it.",
      "\u201cHe's played every single team and every single coverage,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cand knows every way to make them pay.\u201d",
      "That much is true regardless of whether Swift is in the house.",
      "WHAT\u2019S WORKING",
      "The Chiefs sacked Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert five times on Sunday, and each came from a different player \u2014 and none from Chris Jones, whose streak of eight straight regular-season games with a sack came to an end. That production from across the board is a good sign for the Chiefs' pass rush, which has been relying heavily on their All-Pro defensive tackle for years.",
      "\u201cAll of us are versatile, we\u2019re all playing inside or out. Getting us all on the field is huge \u2014 every single one of us can rush,\u201d said Mike Danna, who had one of the sacks Sunday. \"Keep on stacking the reps and getting better with the guys.\u201d",
      "WHAT NEEDS HELP",
      "The Chiefs were penalized six times for 43 yards, but a few of them were particularly painful. One was a questionable block in the back on left guard Joe Thuney well downfield that took away Jerick McKinnon's 48-yard touchdown reception; the Chiefs wound up getting a field goal on the drive instead.",
      "STOCK UP",
      "Second-round draft pick Rashee Rice is quickly developing into an impact wide receiver. He had five catches for 60 yards and a score against Los Angeles, and he's had at least four catches in each of his last three games.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s doing a really good job of just doing what he\u2019s supposed to do and making the plays that he\u2019s supposed to make, not trying to be anything that he\u2019s not,\u201d wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling said. \u201cYou see a lot of rookies come in and try to do too much and can\u2019t figure out the right thing to do and the wrong thing to do. He\u2019s just been doing his job and it\u2019s been paying off for him. He\u2019s a quiet kid who listens to what he\u2019s told to do. He always wants to learn. He\u2019s always taking notes, and it shows.\u201d",
      "STOCK DOWN",
      "Former first-round pick Clyde Edwards-Helaire's time in Kansas City is coming to a lackluster end. He had just two carries for five yards against the Chargers and has 32 for 105 yards through seven games in the final season of his rookie contract.",
      "INJURIES",
      "Playmaking linebacker Nick Bolton fractured his wrist while tackling the Chargers' Keenan Allen. Bolton was only in his second game back after missing the previous three with an ankle injury.",
      "KEY NUMBER",
      "29 and 3 \u2014 Mahomes has 29 wins and three losses in his career against the AFC West. And with the victory over the Chargers, the Chiefs have a three-game lead in the division just seven weeks into the season.",
      "NEXT STEPS",
      "The Chiefs can do more damage in the AFC West race when they visit the Broncos on Sunday. The two will be playing for the second time in three weeks after Kansas City scraped its way to a 19-8 win on Oct. 12 at Arrowhead Stadium. ",

      "\"Austin is the trending boy, like the Lakers' darling of the summer,\" he said of choosing Reaves. \"He just signed this [four-year, $54 million] deal. He's going to Team USA.

      "Stories about a potential Reaves-Swift romance began springing up in Yahoo, Seventeen, the New York Post and Sports Illustrated in June. According to Google Trends, from June 4-10, the search terms \"Austin Reaves and Taylor Swift\" went from having a popularity score of zero to the maximum of 100.\u00a0",
      "In August, fans in the Philippines chanted \"Taylor Swift\" at Reaves as he promoted his signature Rigorer shoe in Manila. By the end of the summer, Reaves was asked to address \u2014 and denied \u2014 the rumor on multiple podcasts, including Showtime's \"All the Smoke\" with former NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson, as well as ESPN's \"The Lowe Post.\" Even Reaves' own teammates texted him about it.\u00a0",
      "\"Someone in the team group message at the time sent it just with a bunch of laugh faces,\" Reaves told FOX Sports last week. \"I can't remember who it was, though. I don't even think I responded to it. I was like, 'Y'all got it. Y'all got this one.'\"",
      "Even more, the Lakers are still talking about it.",
      "Ahead of Lakers Media Day, general manager Rob Pelinka praised Reaves for \"not getting caught up in media rumors about who he's dating.\" And after Sunday's preseason game against Milwaukee, Lakers coach Darvin Ham cracked a joke about Reaves' humility, saying, completely unprovoked, \"He's not afraid to tell Taylor Swift, \u2018No.'\"",
      "All of that was set into motion by a 24-year-old who fired off a tweet from a burner account on June 5 to fabricate that the two were spotted at a bar. But this person wasn't just some random internet troll \u2014 it was an LA Clippers employee.\u00a0",
      "Reaves himself broke out in laughter when FOX Sports told him who started the rumor that followed him all summer.",
      "\"Woooooooow,\" he said, drawing the word out for a few seconds. \"That's crazy. That's actually funny.\"",
      "Zain Fahimullah, a social media design associate for the Clippers, was about to board a flight home to Los Angeles after visiting his family in New York when he saw that Swift and The 1975 singer Matty Healy breaking up was trending on Twitter.",
      "He decided to pile on.",
      "He posted side-by-side photos of Swift and Reaves to his Twitter account, RefrigeratorLAL, writing, \"Following her breakup, Taylor Swift was reportedly seen in an Arkansas Bar this weekend with star Laker basketball player Austin Reaves.\"",
      "\"Since I'm working for the Clippers, I didn't want to tweet it off my main, so I tweeted it off there,\" Fahimullah, a Lakers fan, told FOX Sports last week of his burner account.\u00a0",
      "It may seem as though Fahimullah was engaging in an act of sabotage. After all, the Clippers have long been looked at as the kid brother of Los Angeles basketball, with the Lakers winning a record-tying 17 NBA championships, while the other team down the hall at Crypto.com Arena has never even made it to The Finals.\u00a0",
      "But Fahimullah's intentions were apparently much purer. He just thought the rumor could be funny.\u00a0",
      "\"Austin is the trending boy, like the Lakers' darling of the summer,\" he said, explaining his choice of Reaves. \"He just signed this [four-year, $54 million] deal. He's going to Team USA. Also, the contrast between Austin Reaves and Taylor Swift makes it even funnier. Austin being this small-town kid, like a farmer. And Taylor Swift being this mega-superstar. So, I think that's why I chose him.\"",
      "When Fahimullah's flight landed, his phone had so many notifications that he couldn't believe his eyes.",
      "His tweet currently has 4.4 million views. And it was copied word-for-word by another Twitter account, HoopsMixOnly, which has racked up 7.3 million views. So, more than 11 million people have viewed the rumor on just those two accounts, more than the populations of Greece, Sweden or Portugal.",
      "\"I'm like, 'What?!'\" he said. \"I make a lot of memes and this was like the least effort I've ever put into one. And this is the one that just like blew up.\"",
      "Of course, it didn't take long for the fake news to reach Reaves, who received a text from one of his friends that included the tweet, along with three letters: \"LOL.\"",
      "\"I just started laughing,\" Reaves told FOX Sports. \"I was playing cards with my brother, my best friend and my girlfriend, actually. I said something [about it] and she looked at me and was like, 'Yeah, I've seen that.'\u00a0",
      "\"I was like, 'Yeah, one night when you were asleep I just snuck away and went to a bar.'\u00a0 She obviously laughed about it and said, \u2018If it were at a golf course, I would've been a little more worried.'\"",
      "Reaves' brother, Spencer, weighed in publicly, responding to the tweet with six crying with laughter emoji. \"Austin going to the bar is the most unrealistic part of this whole thing,\" he added in another tweet, referencing Austin's preference for golf clubs over nightclubs.",
      "Nonetheless, the rumor went viral, and still has life whenever Reaves' name is mentioned.",
      "Technically speaking, Fahimullah wasn't the first to jokingly pair up the NBA player and the pop star. Their names were previously mentioned together on Twitter in April, as Reaves helped the Lakers reach the Western Conference finals. That tweet was in response to another Swift dating rumor, but only received 122,000 views, while Fahimullah's caught fire and fueled the news cycle.",
      "[How Austin Reaves, the 'Hillbilly Kobe,' won over LeBron James]",
      "Fahimullah never meant for his tweet to make headlines worldwide. In fact, he cringes whenever Reaves has to answer for it.",
      "\"I felt kind of bad once it started blowing up and people started talking to Austin about it,\" Fahimullah said. \"I was like, 'Damn.' I felt like he shouldn't have to be answering these questions. I really felt bad.\"",
      "Fahimullah was even chastised by his sister, who is a big Swift fan.\u00a0",
      "\"Why did you do this?\" he recalled her saying. \"What's wrong with you?\"",
      "Reaves had a different reaction. He simply found the whole thing amusing.",
      "\"Any time you're in L.A. and you play for the Lakers, you're going to get a lot of attention,\" he told FOX Sports. \"And obviously [Swift] is a superstar herself. So, I think the two names just blew up.\"",
      "The Taylor Swift effect, of course, is very real.",
      "Since being tied to Kelce last month, the tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs has gained over one million Instagram followers, his jersey sales have spiked nearly 400 percent and Chiefs games now rank first among 18-to-49-year-old female viewers, among many other groups.",
      "Reaves, who grew up surrounded by over a hundred cows on a farm in Newark, Arkansas, doesn't have Twitter/X and said he rarely looks at his Instagram. When asked by FOX Sports if he had gained any new followers in light of the Swift whispers, he wasn't sure.\u00a0",
      "But even though he largely eschews social media, there was no escaping this rumor, especially in his hometown of just 1,170 people.\u00a0",
      "\"It was really just a big joke going around town because obviously everybody knows everybody,\" Reaves told FOX Sports. \"So everybody was talking about it, asking if it was true.\"",
      "[The NFL (Taylor\u2019s Version): Every NFL team as a Taylor Swift song]",
      "What shocks Reaves most is that some people actually believed it.\u00a0",
      "It wasn't so much that he could be dating one of the most popular pop stars on the planet. It was more that they were linked to an Arkansas bar, something Reaves believes was a dead giveaway that the whole thing was a farce.",
      "\"Obviously everybody back home knew it wasn't true because, one, I don't really go out like that,\" he said. \"And two, I don't think she would ever go to Arkansas.\u00a0",
      "\"It was definitely funny though seeing the trajectory it went on.\"",

      "We already know several of Travis Kelce's loved ones will be in the building next week when Kelce and the Chiefs take the field. After all, the Chiefs are playing the Eagles \u2014 and Travis's brother, Jason Kelce \u2014 in a rematch of last season's Super Bowl.",
      "But could Travis look and see Taylor Swift in the bleachers (or, more likely, in a VIP suite) next Monday night at Arrowhead Stadium?",
      "It seems unlikely, given that Swift just kicked off the first international leg of her \"Eras Tour\" concert series in South America over the weekend \u2014 with Kelce in attendance as the Chiefs were on a bye.",
      "[Taylor Swift embraces Travis Kelce, changes song lyric for him at Argentina concert]",
      "But, there is a slim opportunity for Swift to jet up to Kansas City on Nov. 20 to support her man, if she is ready for it.",
      "Here's how.",
      "Swift just finished the first weekend of her international tour, which stretches through the end of 2024 with periodic breaks. She had three concerts at River Plate Stadium, a famed soccer venue in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Swift will do another three-concert stop further north in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, this Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\u00a0",
      "Part of the popularity of Swift's \"Eras Tour\" is that, as the name suggests, she features more than 40 hit songs from every era of her career, making a show that lasts over three hours.\u00a0",
      "According to multiple entertainment websites who tracked the U.S. edition of her concert series last summer, Swift usually takes the stage around or after 8 p.m. local time. Thus, the soonest Swift would leave the venue is probably around midnight. Yes, as in the name of her 2022 album.",
      "Flying commercial from one of Brazil's biggest hubs to the self-titled \"Heart of America\" would take at least 16 hours, according to available information. Fortunately for Swift, she likely would be taking a private jet. A nonstop flight between Rio De Janeiro would take roughly 12 hours.\u00a0",
      "With at least one refueling stop likely needed, that would put Swift's total travel time at around 13 hours. We can add an extra 30 minutes for Swift to get from her concert to her plane \u2014 the nearest international airport is about a 20-minute drive away from the stadium where she will be playing, according to Google Maps.",
      "Another factor in Swift's favor is time zones. Rio De Janiero is three hours ahead of Kansas City, which not only gives Swift some time back but also would roughly be the same time adjustment as a U.S. domestic flight from the East Coast to the West Coast.",
      "To sum it all up, if Swift left her concert at around 12:30 a.m. local time Monday morning after her final show, she could conceivably arrive in Kansas City around 11 a.m. local time \u2014 more than enough time to shake off the jet lag and arrive at Arrowhead Stadium by kickoff, which is scheduled for 7:15 p.m. local time.",
      "Swift does not have another concert after then until that Friday in Sao Paulo, giving her plenty of time to travel back down to Brazil.",
      "As the old saying goes, love makes people do unimaginable things \u2014 though it is probably unrealistic for Swift to keep traveling across continents every week while the Chiefs aim to defend their Super Bowl title.\u00a0",
      "But this game is different. It marks just the fifth time in Travis and Jason Kelce's careers that they will play against each other, and first since they became the first pair of brothers to face off in the Super Bowl, where Travis's Chiefs beat Jason's Eagles 38-35 last February.\u00a0",
      "While Jason has been publicly supportive of his brother's new relationship every time he has spoken about it both on the podcast he co-hosts with Travis and to various media outlets, it does not appear he has met Swift since the two started dating.",
      "Of course, Jason is a busy guy in his own right. When he is not working as an All-Pro center and helping the Eagles to an NFL-best 8-1 start to the season \u2014 or being named a Sexiest Man Alive finalist by People \u2014 Jason and his wife, Kylie, are busy raising their three young daughters. In other words, when else would these two couples' extremely busy schedules all align?",
      "Swift already has been seen in public talking with Jason and Travis's mother, Donna, and father, Ed. She could seize upon this opportunity to finally meet Jason. Swift and Travis are reportedly trying to \"see each other as much as they can during this busy season.\" What better time to make the extra effort to see each other one more time than during one of the Chiefs' biggest games of the season?",
      "Plus, if Swift has one NFL rooting interest outside of \"that guy on the Chiefs,\" it's the Eagles \u2014 whom she previously confessed her loyalty to. The Philadelphia-area native even met Travis's current head coach, Andy Reid, back when Reid coached the Eagles.",
      "It might seem like a bold wrinkle into Swift's already-grueling tour schedule. But maybe Swift can pull it off with a message to her new beau \u2014 \"Look what you made me do.\"",

      "Jeffrey Kleintop rang the alarm on a \"cardboard-box recession,\" warned small businesses are facing a credit crunch, and flagged a slowdown in America's services sector during a recent episode of \"The Long View\" podcast.",
      "Charles Schwab's chief global investment strategist also cautioned the economic picture has changed drastically in the past couple of years, suggested inflation may prove stubborn, and highlighted several other risks to investors' portfolios.",
      "Kleintop touched on everything from Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 to Walt Disney World and roach motels during the wide-ranging conversation.",
      "1. \"I am a data junkie. I get up in the morning and I plug my Bloomberg in like an IV.\"",
      "2. \"If I'm on a desert island and I can only get one piece of economic data \u2014 because what else would you want on a desert island? Maybe you're a Beyonc\u00e9 and a bottle-of-rum person. I am a PMI guy. I love the Purchasing Managers' Index. I think it's a wonderful tool.\"",
      "3. \"I find comfort in looking at the plunging demand for cardboard boxes. I've been referring to this as a 'cardboard box recession' because things that are manufactured and shipped tend to go in a box, and because demand for corrugated fiberboard \u2014 which is what most cardboard boxes are made from \u2014 has fallen just like it did in past recessions. So, literally, cardboard boxes are in a recession.\"",
      "4. \"If you're a florist and you were thinking about buying that extra truck and staffing it, it's hard to do that now. Banks are demanding more collateral, higher rates, qualifying fewer borrowers. So, things are getting tighter.\" (Kleintop was highlighting that many small businesses are finding it harder to borrow.)",
      "5. \"We know travel and entertainment have been strong \u2014 just ask Taylor Swift. It's been big, but it's coming down. We've heard that from airlines. You're seeing higher vacancies at hotels, more open reservations on OpenTable.com. I live three miles from Walt Disney World here in Florida. You know what? You can actually get on Space Mountain lately. You don't have to wait two hours.\"\u00a0",
      "6. \"All these signs are indicating that we're seeing a bit of a slowdown in the services sector. That's important because there are 10 times as many services jobs as manufacturing jobs in the US. If we start to see the service sector reflect more signs of this slowdown in demand, well, we might see a weakening labor market, and then that could feed into the retail space, and construction, and so many other areas. Not a deep downturn, but even a small pullback there could really mean a lot when it comes to the labor market.\"",
      "7. \"There's a very different environment in terms of inflation, valuations, interest rates, and credit conditions \u2014 very different from the last cycle, leading to very different leadership in the market. We've turned the corner on a new cycle, whether we ultimately define what we're experiencing right now as an official recession or not.\"",
      "8. \"We don't have a lot of experience with QT. It's a little bit of a roach motel. Like you can check into QE, but it's real hard to check back out again. (Kleintop was referring to quantitative tightening, where the Federal Reserve shrinks its balance sheet to cool the economy, and quantitative easing, where it buys bonds to stimulate growth.)",
      "9. \"The market is enamored of this idea that everything is going to be turning around quickly next year. We just don't see that.\" (Kleintop warned that inflation has rarely plunged and stayed flat and low in past cycles, and suggested a period of higher, more volatile price growth was likely.)",
      "10. \"We don't know how deep and how broad this is. We have a sense of it, but it's been going on for so long. It's one of those things where you just don't know how many things could get broken when it starts to move.\" (Kleintop was flagging the risk that Japan may raise interest rates and strengthen the yen, disrupting the popular \"yen carry trade\" where investors borrow cheaply in Japan then invest the funds for a higher return elsewhere. He warned there could be mass selling of dollar-based investments and other high-yielding currencies and assets.)",

      "His advice stems from Goldman Sachs' outlook that the S&P 500 will deliver a respectable 6% total return in 2024, with the index likely ending the year at 4,700.\u00a0",
      "This isn't the first time Swift has occupied the head space of Wall Street forecasters and economists this year. The singer's immensely successful Eras tour was highlighted in the Federal Reserve's beige book as one reason why hotels in Philadelphia saw a record surge in revenue over the summer.",
      "On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs also pointed to the expansive economic impact of the Taylor Swift effect.",
      "\"The launch of singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's 'Eras' tour represented one of the most notable cultural events of 2023. Global ticket sales are estimated to exceed $1 billion. The tour's economic multiplier effect is significant,\" Kostin said.",
      "The Eras tour is scheduled to end in late November 2024, \"roughly corresponding to the 12-month horizon of the market forecast in this report,\" he added.\u00a0",
      "Kostin's investment recommendation to stay invested in stocks for the next year is based on the expectations that US GDP will grow 2.1% in 2024, profit margins remain stable, equity valuations float in \"fairly valued\" territory, and the Fed ends its interest rate hiking cycle.",
      "That should all translate into continued positive performance from the mega-cap tech stocks, dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven,\" which include Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla.\u00a0",
      "\"The stocks should collectively outperform the remainder of the index in 2024. The seven stocks have faster expected sales growth, higher margins, a greater re-investment ratio, and stronger balance sheets than the other 493 stocks and trade at a relative valuation in line with recent averages after accounting for expected growth,\" Kostin said.",
      "And all of this translates into the idea that investors should stay the course and own stocks throughout next year, despite concerns of a potential recession.",
      "\"As homage to the global icon, our 2024 US Equity Outlook is subtitled 'All You Had To Do Was Stay' \u2013 invested.

      "\n      Retirees\u2019 monthly payments will rise by $59 to an estimated average of $1,907. The lower adjustment reflects the fact that inflation has moderated this year. Recipients had received increases of 8.7% for 2023 and 5.9% for last year, which were the largest since the early 1980s.\n  ",
      "\n      Before the Bell spoke with David Certner, legislative counsel and policy director at AARP to discuss how that will impact the economy. \n  ",
      "\n      (This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\n  ",
      "\nBefore the Bell: How does the Social Security Administration calculate these changes? \n",
      "\nDavid Certner: The Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) is based on the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners. They look at the change in the year-over-year for the third quarter, which just ended in September, to determine the adjustment. So they look at those numbers for July, August and September to come up with the 3.2% cost of living adjustment.\n  ",
      "\nBefore the Bell: The last two annual adjustments have been really large. What does the drop off in 2024 mean?\n",
      "\nDavid Certner: The point of COLA is to make sure that Social Security benefits are not eroded over time due to rising prices. Inflation was running very high over the last couple of years in particular. There\u2019s always good and bad news when you have high inflation in terms of the COLA. Last year we saw one of the highest adjustments in history \u2013 that was a big increase for people. The bad news is that inflation was much higher and most seniors are living on a fixed income so that\u2019s a very bad thing. The COLA helps offset that but it never helps you get ahead. \n  ",
      "\nBefore the Bell: Can you elaborate on what you mean when you say it never helps get you ahead? \n",
      "\nDavid Certner: It\u2019s certainly something that we hear from our members. They appreciate the increase and it is absolutely essential to their financial wellbeing, but nobody ever feels like it\u2019s keeping up with their rising expenses. \n  ",
      "\n      One of the fastest-growing expenses is health care, and that tends to be one of the bigger items for seniors, as you can well imagine. Health care cost increases actually tend to run a bit faster than inflation rates. Last week we saw Social Security increase by 3.2% but the premium for Medicare, that\u2019s the standard premium \u2013 it can get much more expensive, went up almost 6%.\n  ",
      "\n      For most seniors, that premium is automatically deducted from their Social Security check, so it\u2019s eating up a large chunk of that increase.\n  ",
      "\nBefore the Bell: So what does more money in the pockets of seniors mean for the economy? \n",
      "\nDavid Certner: There is a huge impact because Social Security is the largest source of income for most seniors. Most of the money that is being paid out on a monthly basis is being spent and going straight back into the economy. The amount of GDP that\u2019s generated by Social Security checks is actually larger than the total amount of Social Security money going out in the first place. \n  ",
      "\n      As to where that money goes, I would say seniors tend to spend the most in major core areas like housing, healthcare, utilities and food.\n  ",
      "\nBefore the Bell: Could an increase in Social Security possibly add to inflation since that money is bolstering the economy?\n",
      "\nDavid Certner: I think this is why some people get nervous about the cost of increasing payouts. But in many respects this is a self-financing mechanism, because over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve had not only rising prices, but rising wages. Rising wages mean you have more payroll taxes being paid into the Social Security system. So the system is self-correcting in that way.\n  ",
      "\nBefore the Bell: What are some of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to Social Security? \n",
      "\nDavid Certner: A lot of people talk about single year increases in Social Security payments.  But the critical thing is how much it increases over time. If you\u2019re taking your benefit at 65 or 67 and you\u2019re going to be drawing benefits for the rest of your lifetime, you need to think about growth over a 20 or 30 year period. It\u2019s one thing to lose 3% purchasing power in one year, but if you look at the COLA over the past year we saw an increase that totaled up to about 18%. That\u2019s a dramatic impact on purchasing power. \n  ",
      "\n      The built in effect of the COLA is absolutely critical to maintaining the value of the benefit, particularly over time as people are getting older and becoming more reliant on Social Security as they spend down or run out of other assets.\n  ",
      "\n      Rite Aid filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Sunday, a casualty of a miserable environment for drug stores, exacerbated by its runner-up status to bigger chains and expensive legal battles for allegedly filling unlawful opioid prescriptions, reports my colleague David Goldman. \n  ",
      "\n      The bankruptcy was not a surprise. Its bigger rivals, CVS and Walgreens, are also facing many of the same problems. They, too, are closing stores as Amazon and big-box chains like Walmart, Target and Costco serve as more customer-friendly alternatives to nationwide pharmacy chains.\n  ",
      "\n      But Rite Aid is in much worse financial shape than its competitors and unable to weather the storm that has been beating down on the industry. On Thursday, it filed a notice to the US Securities and Exchange Commission saying it would be unable to file its latest quarterly financial report because it was looking at \u201cstrategic alternatives,\u201d which is Wall Street speak for \u201cconsidering bankruptcy.\u201d\n  ",
      "\n      In that filing, the company said it expected its losses would increase significantly in the past quarter, which is saying something, considering it lost about three quarters of a billion dollars between March 2022 and March 2023 \u2014 and another $307 million between March and May this year. Over the past six years, Rite Aid has tallied nearly $3 billion in losses.\n  ",
      "\n      At the beginning of June, the last time the company filed a financial report, Rite Aid had just $135.5 million of cash on hand -\u2014 and $3.3 billion in long-term debt, which exceeded the value of the company\u2019s assets by nearly $1 billion. With rising interest rates, that debt wasn\u2019t cheap to finance.\n  ",
      "\n      \u201cIt was always a matter of when, not if, Rite Aid would file for bankruptcy,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a note to investors. \u201cThe company has been deep in the red for the past six years.\u201d\n  ",

That makes it the highest grossing concert film domestically for an opening weekend, according to AMC.\n  ",

It was No. 1 at the box office in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Australia, Germany and the Philippines. \u201cEras\u201d is set to be released in Brazil, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong on November 3.\n  ",

      "Strong spending by consumers has been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession, and Vivid Seats CEO Stan Chia doesn\u2019t see demand in his industry falling off.",
      "He says customers are still using Vivid Seats to find tickets to concerts, sporting events and the theater even if interest rates are high and sentiment surveys show shoppers say they\u2019re feeling nervous. Vivid Seats\u2019 marketplace allows people to buy and sell their tickets to live events.",
      "Chia told The Associated Press that he believes the explosion of pent-up demand for entertainment outside the house following the pandemic has burned out, and trends have returned more to normal. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Q: It seems like the economy is riding on whether U.S. consumers can keep spending. How do you see the state of the consumer today?",
      "A: I think what we can certainly see in our category is live events continues to be one that consumers are prioritizing in their discretionary income.",
      "This category, while it is discretionary by definition, doesn\u2019t behave like others, like buying a new TV. You don\u2019t really think about buying a new TV in the same way as whether you\u2019re going to a Guns N\u2019 Roses concert.",
      "We are now past any point of potential pent-up demand release. What we\u2019re really into is secular trends of the industry that really drive it forward. I think about where the generational priority is on spending. If you think about Gen Z, as they come into purchasing power they have prioritized experiences over goods and services.",
      "You\u2019ve got folks like myself \u2014 the Guns N\u2019 Roses references shows I\u2019m a geriatric millennial \u2014 I\u2019ve certainly got a little more money than I did 20 years ago, and the bands that I love are touring, and I love the opportunity to go see that.",
      "Q: Can you go back to the idea of pent-up demand? This is no longer just people hungry to go to live events again for the first time after the pandemic shutdowns?",
      "A: Where we fit as marketplace for live events, we are a great barometer for how much demand exceeds supply.",
      "If you go back to maybe 2021, the second half of that year through the first half of 2022, you could look at where our average order size was relative to 2019, for example, and you saw really, really big jumps. That\u2019s where you saw pent-up demand being released. Numerically, just fantastic growth of that magnitude, that\u2019s clearly driven by pent-up demand",
      "In the second half of 2022 and now in 2023, if you were to plot that line, we\u2019re right back on the industry line. The consumer demand is past pent-up demand.Q: So what do you make of all these surveys where consumers say they\u2019re worried? When will they stop spending?",
      "A: I certainly read and see all the things out there about the strength of the consumer and where sentiment is, but in this category, we\u2019ve continued to see strength.",
      "We\u2019re headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, and the example I like to give, which unfortunately is not going to be true this year, is if the Bears go to the Super Bowl, you\u2019re going to see a lot of fans who want to go to that event. This category in particular has that FOMO-esque truth to it. That\u2019s what continues to drive consumer purchasing.",
      "Q: Are you seeing any differences in consumer behavior? Are football fans spending more than baseball fans? Concert goers in high-income ZIP codes versus lower-income ones?",
      "A: I think fandom just traverses all categories and all demographics. You\u2019ve got a very consistent level of intensity whether you\u2019re talking about sports fans, concert fans, theater fans, comedy fans, down to the team level.",
      "Q: Are you worried that this year\u2019s strength for concerts may be because of a couple of high-profile performers like Beyonce and Taylor Swift? Will next year be a regression to the mean?",
      "A: Taylor Swift and Beyonce are phenomenal artists and performers. We\u2019re just so privileged to see them put on amazing shows this year. I think the beauty of the category is there are always amazing artists out there on tour. We\u2019re in the fourth quarter of the year now, we\u2019re excited to hear about the major acts that are going to be playing next year. We just heard Foo Fighters are going on tour next summer.",
      "Q: Does it bother you that one of the first search-engine results for your company is: Is it safe to buy on Vivid Seats?",
      "A: No. Until we become a household name, and we are on our way there, you\u2019re always going to look and see who is this company. You\u2019ll find we are an award-winning customer service company with a 100% buyer guarantee and a rewards program.",
      "Q: There\u2019s a big pushback by customers against fees getting added at the last screen of a transaction online. Any possibility Vivid Seats will show prices including all fees at the first instance?",
      "A: We are so supportive of all efforts and all legislation that drive transparency in all industries. We\u2019re going to continue to be very supportive of a competitive playing field.",
      "We understand that consumers are looking for value in what they purchase, and I think when you look at what we do \u2013 where customers who buy 10 tickets get one (more through a reward credit) \u2014 we put our money where the mouth is.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about critical legal principles, but we\u2019re watching them as they happen and as they happened,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really just turns that lightbulb on for law students.\u201d",

      "\u201cNo knock on the other courses,\u201d the 26-year-old from Lawrence, Kansas, said. \u201cI just find that my attention is more easily grabbed when I\u2019m sitting in class listening to Steve Sadow talk about how he was able to get Rick Ross out of jail as opposed to sitting in constitutional law or torts or whatever it may be.\u201d",

      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- A South Dakota law professor typically teaches about dense topics like torts and natural resources. But next semester, he and his fearless students are shaking things up by turning their attention to Taylor Swift. ",
      "Sean Kammer wanted his legal writing course to draw on music and art to help his students reconsider legal language and craft persuasive arguments. The self-described \u201cSwiftie\u201d thought a focus on the cultural icon was also a way to connect with his students.",
      "Never in his wildest dreams did Kammer expect the attention that the announcement generated \u2014 the class filled up quickly and jealous alumni even reached out.",
      "\u201cThe reaction from students has been exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can have fun while we\u2019re exploring some of these complex theoretical problems or issues, I believe students will be inspired to think deeper and to push themselves further.\u201d",
      "Swifties at the University of South Dakota Knudson School of Law aren\u2019t the only ones having fun. Law professors across the country are increasingly drawing on popular culture and celebritydom \u2014 sometimes with the help of celebrities themselves \u2014 to engage a new generation of students and contextualize complicated concepts in the real world.",
      "Courses on Swift, Rick Ross and Succession supplement traditional law school courses with fun and accessible experiences that professors say they often didn\u2019t have themselves.",
      "Students at the Georgia State University College of Law were hustlin\u2019 everyday to get to class \u2014 especially on Tuesday when they got to hear directly from Ross for the final day of a course that chronicled the legal intricacies of the rapper, record executive and Wingstop franchise owner\u2019s life.",
      "Moraima \u201cMo\u201d Ivory, director of the school\u2019s entertainment, sports and media law program, wants her students to see for themselves what goes into the albums, television shows and movies they enjoy. She chooses a star each year and invites guest speakers from their world, along with the title character themselves, to bring legal deals, defenses and drama to life.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about critical legal principles, but we\u2019re watching them as they happen and as they happened,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really just turns that lightbulb on for law students.\u201d",

      "\u201cNo knock on the other courses,\u201d the 26-year-old from Lawrence, Kansas, said. \u201cI just find that my attention is more easily grabbed when I\u2019m sitting in class listening to Steve Sadow talk about how he was able to get Rick Ross out of jail as opposed to sitting in constitutional law or torts or whatever it may be.\u201d",

      "Courses on A-list celebrities have captivated undergraduate and graduate students across the country for years, increasingly in courses analyzing race and gender.

      "Two months ago, interior designer Kelly Straka had never listened to Taylor Swift's music. Now, she's handpicking lyrics from the singer-songwriter's catalog to paint on the walls.\u00a0",
      "\"It's been daunting to jump into this world she created,\" Straka, 39, told Insider.",
      "Her swift change of heart was a business decision. In September, Straka purchased a $680,000, four-bedroom home in Scottsdale, Arizona, that was already being used as an Airbnb. The old owners, she said, were ready to move on. Straka knew she needed to find a niche to stay booked in an area that was overcrowded with short-term rentals. A rapid increase in the supply of Airbnbs has made it more competitive for hosts to stay booked.\u00a0",
      "Straka turned to the pop-culture phenomenon of singer Taylor Swift and her legion of dedicated fans. Uninitiated, she's relied on group chats with \"Swiftie\" friends to vet ideas and has joined numerous Facebook groups to hone in on what die-hard fans might want in a short-term rental that sleeps 12.\u00a0",
      "Now, she's submerged into a Swiftie bubble. Straka has been living in the Scottsdale Swiftie paradise for the past two months, working from 7 a.m. to midnight to prepare for her first guests in December.\u00a0",
      "Straka has tried to match each of the Airbnb's four bedrooms to a different album, or era, as fans like to call them: \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" \"Reputation,\" \"Folklore,\" and \"Evermore.\"",
      "The living area is \"Lover\" themed, while the backyard with an in-ground pool is set up to look like the music-video set for \"You Need To Calm Down.\"",
      "Straka said the \"Lover\" living room was easy with cotton-candy colors and a heart motif. Other albums, like \"Evermore,\" have been harder to crack.\u00a0",
      "When she can, Straka has tried to do things on a budget. The house came completely furnished and she's tried to match existing furniture to her theme rooms. An orange couch was assigned to what she's describing as a western-leaning \"Evermore\" room. For some areas, she's printed out photos of Swift's red carpet looks or promotional appearances.\u00a0",
      "Custom murals in each room that depict things like pink clouds or a night sky run about $1,000. Straka said her favorite one has been for the \"Reputation\" room, which leans heavily on newspaper imagery, like the album's front cover. Straka said she tries to choose iconic lyrics for each room and asks her friends which ones resonate the most.",
      "The most expensive room to decorate is based on \"Folklore,\" with an album cover that depicts Swift in a forest. Straka spent $6,000 for expensive faux flower installations that hang from the room's ceiling and run down the walls. She even covered the nightstands in fake moss, to mimic a piano that Swift uses during her concerts.\u00a0",
      "Straka's favorite detail has been the flow between the different rooms and eras.",
      "\"You can feel how she's in a different place in her life in each room,\" Straka said.\u00a0",
      "Scottsdale is a hotbed for bachelorette parties, Straka said, and she's preparing to partner with professional vendors to offer packages to interested guests. The Swift theme is an easy pairing, she said.\u00a0",
      "\"It's just one step away, the bachelorette parties are already wearing cowboy hats and boots,\" she said. Professional party packages can start around $1,000 and include amenities such as a private chef and custom decorations like balloon arches.\u00a0",
      "Straka said a TikTok she made garnered over 500,000 views in two days and has drummed up tons of interest in the property on the Airbnb platform. Bookings are now open with the first guests staying in the property in December. Straka anticipates that during the peak travel season of September to April the Airbnb will grab as much as $1,400 a night on weekends and $500 a night on weekdays.",
      "After diving into her world, Straka joked she's being followed by Swift. On a recent trip to Home Depot, Swift's music began playing. While painting one bedroom, the local news announced she was recently named a billionaire after the success of her \"Eras\" world tour.\u00a0",
      "\"She's unavoidable,\" Straka said.",
      "But she's ready to pivot themes if the Swiftie fervor dies down. In the meantime, she's picked a favorite song \u2014 \"Bad Blood\" \u2014 and has been watching Swift's music videos on a loop. After not knowing a single lyric just a few weeks ago, she might be a Swiftie after all.",

But for the 2,000 years before that, the story of the Jews was one of perseverance through persecution, flight, and the kind of intimate, house-to-house slaughter Israelis awoke to on the morning of Oct. 7. What Hamas recorded on smart phones and uploaded to social media was a 21st century pogrom. The massacre of more than 1,400 people renewed and validated the dread that resides in every Jewish Israeli as a kind of inheritance\u2014the embedded collective memory of trauma that has kept a society\u2019s sense of confidence eggshell-thin even behind the most powerful fighting force in the Middle East.",
      "What that military is directing onto the Gaza Strip\u20146,000 bombs in the first six  days\u2014had by Oct. 17 killed more than 3,000 people. For Palestinians, the Israel-Hamas War is likely the worst trauma since the Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d as they refer to the 1948 victory of the Jewish army that, in establishing a Jewish homeland, exiled more than 700,000 Arabs who claimed the same land. Their descendants\u2019 defiant presence in blockaded Gaza (where 2.2 million people are ruled by Hamas), and on the West Bank (where 3 million chafe under Israeli military occupation), has posed a persistent challenge not only for Israel\u2019s security, but also for the moral code cultivated during the millennia that Jews had not a state, but a tradition. Revenge hangs in the air over Gaza along with cordite. And just as no Gentile can apprehend the horror of the Oct. 7 sabbath, nothing can communicate the experience of bombardment.",
      "Imagine enduring both. The roughly 200 hostages Hamas carried away at gunpoint were awakened at dawn by the terror of a missile onslaught and faced the darkness of Gaza beneath the thunder of Israeli munitions. They form a kind of human bridge between two realms. \u201cI can only hope that she is being held in Gaza,\u201d says the son of 74-year-old Vivian Silver, a peace activist missing from her kibbutz. \u201cWhat a terrible hope that is.\u201d",
      "With power cut off by Israel, accounts of the profound suffering in Gaza are largely being told from a distance. And in a conflict that has always been about competing narratives, Hamas ensured that attention would be on the hostages and their loved ones. The families speak wrenchingly about what they know and the torment of what they don\u2019t. Searching for hope, they find themselves at the mercy both of terrorists and of the intelligence apparatus of an Israeli government that failed them on Oct. 7, then ignored them in the chaotic days that followed.",
      "But they have their fellow citizens. After the worst loss of Jewish lives since the Holocaust, it was Israelis\u2014the legions rising to donate blood, to prepare food, to report for duty\u2014who confirmed why their nation exists.",

      "Cohen\u2019s sister, Judith Raanan, 59, and niece, Natalie Raanan, 17, were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nahal Oz. Both live in Evanston, Ill. ",
      "They arrived in Israel on Sept. 2 for family occasions\u2014my mom\u2019s 85th birthday. They wanted to stay here with us for the Jewish holidays. Judith is an artist; she paints. Natalie just graduated from high school and she decided to take a gap year until she figures out what she wants to do. She was debating between studying beauty care or interior design. She has a passion for animals, especially dogs. Her dog Panda had just died, and she told us that when she comes back to the States she wants to get a new French bulldog. She was thinking maybe to go study something that has to do with beauty care. She\u2019s a very precious girl, a pretty girl. I cannot even begin to think what she's going through. ",
      "Saturday morning, we woke up to a devastating war. There were 150 terrorists in the kibbutz. I was in touch with [Natalie and Judith] through WhatsApp messages, because everybody there was told not to speak over the phone, or just whisper. The last message was at 12:18. Natalie wrote that they're hearing shots, and they're in the security room. And they're OK and they love us. That was the last signal of life we had from them. They stopped answering me.",
      "At first we thought, you know, maybe they had no battery left. Maybe they could rest a little bit, although it doesn't make sense to rest when they're shooting at you. But about two hours later, we started feeling something was wrong. There was no army there yet. We asked security people from the kibbutz to go check on them, but they couldn't, because there were terrorists everywhere, people murdered and injured. They couldn't get to their apartment.\u00a0",
      "IDF forces found my mom at 10:30 at night. My mom refused to be evacuated until she knew what was happening with them. We told the IDF that they are American citizens; we thought maybe that would help. When they got to the apartment, the doors were thrown out and the windows were broken, and they were nowhere to be found. The clothes were all over the floor. Their mobiles and their laptop and their passports were taken. And they were taken. At that moment, we knew. ",
      "Each night I sleep only four hours. What goes on in my mind is that they\u2019re going through terrible things, especially Natalie. When I go to bed, about 2 a.m., I feel like I do not deserve to be in bed, because she\u2019s probably being raped somewhere. We are working with American authorities, with Israeli authorities, trying to get a sign of life\u2014a signal. ",
      "Yesterday, I went to speak with additional families that were rescued from the kibbutz. And we found out from an eyewitness that Judith and Natalie were taken from their apartment to another family\u2019s apartment, and they brought in another family, two parents and two daughters, and another family with young children. And they took Natalie and Judith and gathered them all together in the kitchen of that apartment. The mother I spoke to, Hamas murdered her 18-year old daughter. The daughter was dead in the next room when Judith and Natalie were taken in.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "Hamas took the two husbands and Judith and Natalie handcuffed into a car, they were alive and uninjured according to the eyewitness. We know that they can be found alive. We know from an eyewitness that Hamas took them uninjured. This is why we have hope. We know that they left there on their feet, unharmed, from that apartment. But since then, we know nothing. And this is why time is crucial.\u00a0",

      "Polin\u2019s son, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, was injured and abducted at the Nova music festival in southern Israel ",
      "My wife and I both grew up in Chicago. We then were living for professional reasons in Northern California, where Hersh was born. We moved when he was four to Richmond, Va. And when he was seven, the family moved to Israel, in July 2008.\u00a0",
      "Friday night, Hersh was home with us in Jerusalem. We went to synagogue for the Shabbat and the Jewish holiday that was coinciding with Shabbat. Afterwards, we went to a friend's house for dinner with two other families. And at 11 p.m., he came and said goodbye to us. He had a backpack on and he was going to meet up with his friend, Aner Shapira. We didn't know where they were going. We just figured they were going camping somewhere.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "Saturday morning, I got up and left at 7:30 to go to the synagogue. I was hearing booms and figured there was something going on, but didn't know what. When I got to the synagogue we continued to hear booms. Those of us who were in the synagogue that morning went several times in and out of the bomb shelter.\u00a0",
      "I got home at about 9:30. My wife immediately showed me that she had turned on her phone, which she doesn't normally use on Shabbat, because it\u2019s prohibited on the Jewish Sabbath, and showed me that we had received two back-to-back text messages from Hersh at 8:11 a.m. The first message said: \u201cI love you.\u201d The second message said: \u201cI'm sorry.\u201d ",
      "We knew he was in some sort of distress, but we didn't even know where he was. My daughter got online and saw that there was a big music festival in the south. My wife reached out to Hersh and Aner\u2019s third very close friend, and that third friend confirmed that they'd gone to the festival.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "From about 1 p.m. Saturday until now, we've had an ongoing mini-situation room set up in my apartment with seven, eight, 10, 12 people. We had two different friends each go to a different hospital in the south to see if they could find our son. They went through unidentified bodies and did not see him. ",
      "At some time\u2013I think it was Sunday morning\u2013a picture started to circulate online that was from an outdoor bomb shelter. They're not uncommon in the south of Israel. Our son was in the picture, as was Aner. Through social media, we started to search for other families of people who were in the shelter and to try to piece together a story. What we have subsequently pieced together, based on conversations with the three witnesses who were in the shelter with him, is the following. ",
      "Sometime around 7:30 Saturday morning, those in the bomb shelter came under heavy gunfire. Grenades were being tossed into the shelter. Hersh's friend Aner, who was by the entrance of the bomb shelter, is responsible for the lives of anybody who's still alive\u2014he was picking up grenades and tossing them back out and taking control of the situation. But it was total chaos. At least 11 grenades were thrown into the shelter. Aner picked up eight grenades and threw them back out. Three exploded inside.",
      "People were being critically wounded by the gunfire and grenades. And what we next know from witnesses is that at roughly 9 a.m., gunmen came into the shelter calmly, not shooting, and they said anybody who can get on their feet and walk out walk out of here, walk out. And our son was one of some small number of people to walk out, around five or six people.\u00a0",
      "The witnesses who have shared this information with us have confirmed for us that our son's left arm had been severed from the elbow down. He's a lefty. And he was bleeding. But he's a trained medic so he had fashioned for himself a tourniquet of sorts on his arm. I don't know how he did it\u2013somehow using one of his shirts.\u00a0",
      "Witnesses say that he was taken onto a pickup truck under gunpoint and the truck drove off. That's the last time anybody that we can identify saw him. The Israeli police last identified a ping to his telephone at 12:45pm on Saturday on the Gaza border. From that time, we don't know where he is. We don't know what condition he's in. We don't know if the truck pulled away and threw him on the side of the road and shot him. We don't know if he was taken into Gaza. We have no idea.\u00a0",
      "Since midday Saturday, we've had a team of supporters here around the clock making calls to hospitals, to authorities, trying to work through U.S. government authorities, trying to get to humanitarian international aid agencies, trying to get to foreign governments that we think might be potentially influential. Right now we have a team working full speed with the number one goal being get Hersh the medical treatments that he needs immediately. Of course we'd prefer that being at home in Israel, but if not, then at least he can get it in Gaza.\u00a0",
      "And on behalf of all the hostages, we're working everything we can to get them all brought home. The police have requested samples of Hersh\u2019s DNA so I\u2019ve brought them his toothbrush and his hair from his pillowcase at their request. I\u2019ve also provided his last known dental X-rays. We're doing everything we can to bring Hersh home.",

      "She went to the party Friday night with a friend. I woke up on Saturday morning and I saw what was happening. I called her: the phone was ringing and there was no answer. I called the friend, too, but his phone was off. The only thing I know is that Saturday morning at 7:17, she sent a message to one of the people in the party: \u201cThey are shooting us. Please come save us.\u201d ",

She\u2019s painting, learning how to make tattoos. She is my best friend. She\u2019s like a mother to my youngest girl. Every mom will say this about her child, but Mia was so, so special. She\u2019s all my world. Their father is not part of their lives, and she\u2019s very, very important to us, and she\u2019s just vanished. I have no clue where she is.

      "We were all together, all the family, three weeks of travel in South Africa with Yarden and her partner, Alon, and their daughter, Geffen. They were just heading back to Israel for the [Jewish] holiday eve on Friday, and they were staying with Alon's family in Kibbutz Be'eri. Me and my father, we stayed in South Africa. ",
      "She sent pictures of her with Geffen in the shelter, saying that they\u2019re alright, and just waiting for it to end. From South Africa, we did not understand what was going on and how unusual this was. Half an hour had passed, and then one hour, and then two hours, and there was no connection. We were just starting to understand that this is an extremely unusual situation\u2014that there are terrorists that got into Israel, and that they were everywhere. ",
      "We decided to go on the road, a 15-hour drive to the airport, to go back to Israel. We hoped that we would have more information and we will hear from her that everything is fine. That didn\u2019t happen.",
      "When we landed, we got a call. The brother of Alon got a call from him from another cell phone saying that he is here with Geffen, healthy. They got to the army and they are okay and they are on their way to us. But he doesn\u2019t know where Yarden is. ",
      "[Alon's brother] told us the story. They were in the shelter when those terrorists came to their house. They took Alon, Yarden, and Geffen to a car that went to the [Israel-Gaza] border. Just before the border, Alon and Yarden decided to jump out of the car to try to escape. Geffen was in Yarden\u2019s arms. She is 3 years old, so she literally held her in her arms. They were all barefoot and wearing pajamas. They started to run, and when the terrorists started to run after them and shoot at them, Yarden passed Geffen to Alon because she knew that he can run faster. Yarden found a place to hide, and Alon also, but it was much further than Yarden was, and that was the point where they were separated. Alon and Geffen were hiding for almost 24 hours. He didn\u2019t know what happened to Yarden. All night, he heard [the terrorists] going around them and looking for them, so he couldn\u2019t reach out. ",
      "My oldest brother Gili went back to the fields to look for her because we had hoped that maybe she is still hiding somewhere. Alon also went to the field to look for her. They spent four days searching. We didn\u2019t find her. We\u2019re pretty sure that they took her and that she\u2019s in Gaza, although we don\u2019t know it for sure, because we didn\u2019t get any information about her. Right now, her status is missing.",
      "My sister was working as a physical therapist. She lived in the kibbutz for four years, until this year. She was doing her studying in Sheikh Jarrah, in East Jerusalem. She is quiet and humble and she has a really good connection to people. She has a lot of empathy and care. This is really the person she is, and this is who she was also for me. My mother had cancer and passed away last year. This year, Yarden was for me really a mother.",
      "Right now, I'm really focusing on her health and that she will be okay over there and that she will be back. I'm not a politician. There is a lot of pressure everywhere. I can understand that the situation is really complex and there is a war right now. And this is making the whole story really complicated because this is not an army against an army. These are innocent people here that need to be saved.",
      "We\u2019re all together with Alon, with Geffen. Everyone here is playing with her and making sure that she's fine. Right now, she knows that mama is missing. She doesn't know why, or how, or the details of anything. Obviously, she was there, but she didn't understand what was going on. I'm sure that she understands that this is a serious issue because she is just acting perfectly and not crying at all, not yelling\u2014just being the best child that she can. This is not usual. This is her understanding what she should do to help her mother. I hope that she will get her back.",

She is alive on the video, but we don't know what is going on now. We know that they probably took her. She was in their jeep, with other girls. We went to the police to show them the video and to say that we identify my sister so they can do something. The same evening, military officers came to our door and they said to us that my sister Karina is held in the hands of a terror organization. From this moment, we do not know any other information.

She always comforts me. Even [though] she's my little sister, I can always come to her and she will be logical with me and make me come together. She is very lovely. She is very innocent. She is very childish, although she is now a teenager. She likes to decorate her room. She likes stickers and the fluffy dolls of the animals. She loves to paint. She loves cosmetics; she is always doing my make-up. I do not understand anything about it. I remember the day she was born because the gap between us is five years.

At this time my brother in the south of Israel started getting the news of what's going on and he started trying to communicate with my parents.",
      "At the beginning they answered him. They were locked down in the shelter, eight of them together. It was almost all the family, except my uncle and aunt. They told my brother that they're keeping safe and they're following all of the orders and then at around 10:30 in the morning or 11:00 he tried to text them again. And they wrote back that they're in very big trouble and that they love us. And that was actually the last text we received from them. ",
      "From that point on, we tried everything and anything to get in touch and to understand what's going on. But the reality in the kibbutz was like a horror film. We kept getting messages from people saying that they're being chased. There's gunshots everywhere. Houses are being set on fire. But we had no idea where my parents were, or my sister and her young children. ",
      "A friend of my father called him more than 100 times and eventually someone answered in Arabic. They said in broken Hebrew, \u201chostage, hostage, Gaza, Gilad Shalit.\u201d And so at that point, there was some indication that they had been kidnapped. But we still didn't know at that point if any of the Israeli forces reached their house, because the fighting went on for almost three days in the kibbutz. ",
      "We finally received a message that the IDF forces were in their house but they didn\u2019t tell us what they saw or what\u2019s happening. Later on, we received a video of the house, which was completely ruined, burned down. Nothing really was left, but the shelter was empty, and they didn't find any bodies. And they didn't see any signs of blood or something like that. At this point, we realized that all of my family\u2014including my three-year-old niece and my eight-year-old nephew\u2014have probably been abducted by Hamas. We had no idea if they're together or not, or what has been done. The only thing we saw was a video that Hamas released where we recognized my sister's husband being handcuffed and put into the back of a car. He was alive, so these were the only indications. We knew their cell phone locations were somewhere around the Gaza border. But ever since then, we have no new information and we have no idea if they are alive, if they are together, where the children are, if they are being kept safe. ",

We're eight days into the situation and we have no idea of anything. If you look at the list, you see that so many are elderly people and children and women. My parents and my uncle take medication that is really critical for them. We haven't received any information, not from the Red Cross and not from other organizations so this is the situation now. I'm 30 weeks pregnant right now. The first few days were unbearable. I was frightened that I was not going to manage to stay healthy.

While my cousin and his five youngest children were inside the safe room hearing everything. Then they put the house on fire. The safe room was intended to protect against missiles.

So it was like two people fighting over whose hand was stronger. When they put the house on fire, the handle became very hot. So he got burned. But still, he didn't let go, because he knew if he\u2019s going to let go of the handle, they're going to slaughter them. After seven hours, the army came to rescue him. ",
      "In the evening Amos went to his parents' house, and there he saw his father from the window. They had managed to penetrate the safe room from the window, using a bomb. From the window they managed to shoot him. And his wife Adina Moshe saw the whole scene. She saw her beloved husband lying on the floor with dozens of bullets. She tried to stop the blood, but she couldn\u2019t. About 15 minutes after they came for her. And they took her to the Gaza Strip.",
      "We found out that her picture was put online by the AP. You see her on a motorcycle with two terrorists. She's sitting in the middle between the two terrorists. Think about the situation. A few minutes ago she saw her husband, the one that she loved for the last 50 years, murdered in front of her eyes and now they're taking her to an unknown place in Gaza Strip. ",
      "I want to tell you a few words about my aunt. She's a very powerful woman. She's very strong. But you can see on her face that she was terrified. She's 72. Nobody kidnaps a 72-year-old woman. Nobody kidnaps babies. ",
      "When I was a child, I spent my summer vacation at the same house. They have lived in the same house for 50 years. It was a desert when they came there. And they made the desert into heaven. Everything was green. They raised potatoes and peanuts and carrots and they loved to be farmers. They were simple farmers, and grew food for everybody. They also loved Palestinians. They gave food to Palestinians every weekend. They have a lot of friends there. They worked with a lot of Palestinian friends who worked in their fields. And the relationship was perfect until Hamas came into power. Hamas is not only terrifying for the Israelis, but also for the Palestinians. It is something I want the world to know. We love the Palestinians. We don't hate them. We want to live side by side. ",

      "Lyndon\u2019s friend, peace activist Vivian Silver, was taken hostage at Kibbutz Be\u2019eri.\u00a0",
      "I first met Vivian quite a long time ago at a peace demonstration, of course, in Jerusalem. She's kind of like an institution in herself. She's helped to found and catalyze all these different organizations and movements. She moved to Israel decades ago and has only created and built things since then around women's rights and feminism, around Arab-Jewish relations inside Israel, and around Israeli-Palestinian relations cross-border. She was basically one of the founding members of Alliance for Middle East Peace [ALLMEP]. She knows everybody and knows everything. When I'm saying she's an encyclopedia of peace-building and civil society, it's totally true. But it would give someone an impression that she's kind of austere or haughty. She's so much fun. You know the kind of people that are the smartest people in every room they walk into, but they don't need to make everybody know that? She carries her wisdom really lightly and with a lot of humility.",
      "The way in which I worked with her most closely I guess was in her role as co-founder of Women Wage Peace, which she co-founded right after the 2014 Israel-Gaza war. And it tells you everything you need to know about her. The way she reacted to that horrible war\u2014up until the last few days it was the worst escalation we've seen between Israel and Gaza. She lived right on the border at Kibbutz Be'eri. She's like,\u00a0No, I'm going to work to build this women's movement\u00a0that's focused on peace and equality and now has almost 50,000 members.",
      "Before the closure of Gaza and the Second Intifada, she spent a ton of time in Gaza. She has lots of friends in Gaza from those times and had worked really, really hard to put Gaza on the agenda in Israel. It's hard to overemphasize how invisible Gaza is when there's not rockets firing. People just forget it's there. Even sometimes the Israeli left. And Vivian was always the voice in the room who was like, 'No, we need to talk about Gaza, about Gazans, rehumanize them.' And that's what makes her kidnapping all the more tragic. This is an Israeli that was focused on this, who knew so deeply the reality of Gaza, who could probably draw you a map of Beit Lahia or Gaza City from her mind.",
      "The last that we heard from her was a little after 11 a.m., when she was telling people over WhatsApp that \"there's Hamas gunman in my vicinity.\" We heard on Sunday that Vivian was unaccounted for. We don't know for definite that she is in Gaza. There is no confirmed sighting of her being taken in. So we found ourselves\u2014both us and Vivian's sons\u2014in this weird position of hoping she's been taken hostage because the alternative is that she's dead. Her house had been totally torched and decimated. But there was no sign of any human remains anywhere there. So we think that's another data point that would suggest she was taken to Gaza.",
      "We have a working group of folks from our space who are trying to help. We're liaising obviously with her family a bit as well and the wider community of Kibbutz Be'eri, which is a very left-wing kibbutz. There've been some beautiful messages for people from the kibbutz about discouraging this full force assault on Gaza, the response. I know if Vivian was here, she'd be doing that too.",

      "Doron\u2019s nephew, Nitzan Libstein, 19, is missing from Kfar Aza. Doron\u2019s brother, Ofir, 50, was killed, along with Ofir\u2019s mother-in-law Bilha Epstein, 80, and Ofir\u2019s nephew, Netta Epstein, 21. ",
      "I was in Herzliya around 6:30 a.m. Saturday, and I got a phone call that something was happening in the south. I turned on the TV and saw what was happening. I immediately wrote to my brother, \u201cHow are you, what\u2019s happening?\u201d This is the first time we had terrorists entering the kibbutzim in huge numbers. ",
      "At 9:10 I got a message from Aviv, the oldest son of my brother, that said \u201cI love you.\u201d I said, \u201cI love you too.\u201d He said, \u201cMy father was killed.\u201d He said, \"Please tell everyone.\" I ran immediately to my mother, who is 78, to tell her immediately what happened so she would not find out from the TV.  ",
      "Ofir was informed that terrorists were entering his kibbutz. He left the house immediately to go to the safe room in the kibbutz to get his weapon. He got the weapon. He came back and started to fight. But he was one against really something like 70 to 100 terrorists, who shot him and killed him.\u00a0",
      "Ofir\u2019s mother-in-law was killed at the entrance of her house. She went out to pick up her phone and probably the same group killed her. Her name is Bilha Epstein. She was 80. Then those people went after the building where young people were living. Netta was with his girlfriend and they threw two grenades into the room. I don't know how, but he managed to tell his girlfriend to go under the bed and he jumped on the grenade.",
      "An hour later, Nitzan called his mother and told her that the terrorists were in his room. He went to the safe room and held the door so they would not get in. But they fired on the door, and he was injured in his leg from the shots. He was guided on the phone by his brother and his cousin how to treat himself because he was alone in his room. On Wednesday I went to see his room and I saw the amount of blood. He managed to treat himself and he was waiting to be saved. But the army arrived very late, around 2:30 and only at 4 did they manage to get into his room. They told us that in his room there were only four terrorists. They killed them, but they couldn\u2019t find Nitzan. Since his telephone died at 2:35 p.m. on Oct. 7, we haven\u2019t heard from him. Not knowing is sometimes more difficult than knowing.",

      "Kowalsky\u2019s niece, Roni Eshel, 19, was taken from Nahal Oz army base  ",
      "Roni is a soldier with the IDF. She was a scout. Her job was to watch the monitors at the border fence. We think she's missing along with five other female soldiers in her unit. The last time that we heard from Roni was when she told her mom by text message, \u201cMom, don't worry about me. I love you.\u201d And three hearts. Her mom sent her back, \u201cI love you baby girl. I love you, sweetheart. Take care of yourself.\u201d Since 9:27 AM on October 7, we haven't heard from Roni. We don't know her whereabouts. We don't know if she's dead or alive.\u00a0 We don't know if she's been captured or if she is being treated okay.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "Saturday morning I called Sharon, Roni's mother, and I asked her, have you spoken to Roni? She said yes, she called me and she's okay. At 7:30 p.m. I called Sharon again, and I said \u201chave you heard from Roni?\u201d And she said, \u201cNo. I haven't heard from her for hours.\u201d Sharon said, \u201cI'm worried sick. We need to find her.\u201d",
      "And this is when we became a war room family. Each and every one of us that is well-connected everywhere in Israel and outside of Israel started pulling all the strings possible. I reached out to dozens of people to help me find information about Roni, because no one knew what was happening down there in Nahal Oz. I reached out to people who were doing their reserves service, and were going down there, and I reached out to people from all over the hospitals to run through the lists, and we showed her picture. ",
      "We got a rumor on Sunday saying that they were being evacuated to a base called Julis. So I flipped the world upside down to find someone from that base. And I found people, and they say it wasn't true. The day after, we got a rumor about a helicopter coming from Nahal Oz, saying there were five female soldiers on it. So we went all through the hospitals again and again and again\u2014nothing. She wasn't anywhere.",
      "We haven't slept. We haven\u2019t eaten. The government also didn't approach us, or say anything, because they also didn't really know all the facts and the scenes were so horrifying. We thought we would have a list of everyone who is dead within 24 hours. But people are still getting notice about their dead now.",
      "I want to tell people who might have a concept in their head of what a soldier is that she's a little girl, and she has a mother, and she has a father, and she has two brothers younger than her and she has a dog. His name is Dooby. And she likes Taylor Swift and Harry Styles, and her plans were to go and see one of these concerts after she finished her military duty one year from now. ",
      "As the time passes, there's no good outcome. The best thing I can wish for my niece is to be captured by monsters.",

      "I\u2019m following my cousin through social media, and she shared with us her excitement about taking part in this music festival to showcase her jewelry. Moran is a jewelry designer. She uploaded some videos during the festival, so I knew she was there.\u00a0",
      "I don\u2019t know if you can imagine what it is like to wake up to the sound of explosions\u2013and I don\u2019t live close to the Strip at all. There still weren\u2019t sirens or anything. I looked at my husband and I said, \u201cWhat is this? This is crazy.\u201d Within 20 seconds the sirens started, and while we were sitting in the shelter, my husband started looking at Twitter and Instagram and he was saying \u201cThis is absolutely insane, this is absolutely insane.\u201d We have three kids that were sitting with us in the bomb shelter, so he didn\u2019t want to scare them too much. Then he said, \u201cThey attacked at the festival.\u201d And that was when the realization dawned on me: she is there. ",
      "From that moment on, I knew my life could never return to what it was before. We started trying to get in contact with every hospital and doctor we could, to see if she had maybe arrived wounded or something. We found out that at some point she called someone and said that she managed to run away with some friends on a vehicle, and we shouldn\u2019t worry. And the whole time she was saying that she was trying to get out of there, and she was okay, but she was hiding, and she kept having to hide, but soon she would get out. The hours passed, and from what we understood, at some point the group of friends split up. Moran ran away, and nobody has heard from her since 9:00 in the morning that day. ",
      "We finally found a video on TikTok that showed the terrorists with Moran, who has been captured. That was the last and only evidence we have from her.\u00a0",
      "I want people to know that Moran is the most loving, caring person I know. Full, full, full of compassion and love for other human beings, always seeking peace. Such a positive person in all her interactions. Warm, happy, just radiating positive energy. And the most horrible situation anyone could possibly imagine happened to her.",

      "Alony\u2019s sister, Sharon Alony-Cunio, 34; Sharon\u2019s husband David Cunio, 33;and their twin 3-year-old daughters, Emma and Julie, were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir-Oz, along with Alony\u2019s older sister Danielle Alony, 45, and her daughter Emilia, 5",
      "Saturday morning we woke up to a missile alarm in Rehovot. We sent a WhatsApp message to my sisters. Sharon said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. We were just told that there are terrorists in the kibbutz, and we\u2019re in the safe room.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
      "After a while, she sent a message to the family Whatsapp group, saying \u2018We hear the terrorists at our neighbor\u2019s home.\u2019\u2019 At 9:30 a.m., she wrote that the terrorists were in the house. At 11:00 am, she called and left a voice message, saying \u201cThey are burning the house and smoke is getting under the door and she doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s going to make it, and she loves us.\u201d ",
      "She sent me coordinates. I tried to send it to people in the army or police or whatever. The last message she sent directly to me, not in the family Whatsapp. It said: \u201chelp, we\u2019re dying.\u201d ",
      "We came across an article in which one of the survivors described her point of view of everything that happened. During the kidnapping, she met two parents from the kibbutz that had 3-year-old twins. I found her phone number and called her. She said that they kidnapped her from her safe room. I heard that the terrorists went door by door, and they said, If you don\u2019t open, we\u2019re going to burn you down. The ones that opened got kidnapped. The ones that didn\u2019t got burned.",
      "They kidnapped the survivor and ran her to a field where a truck was waiting. When she got into the truck, she saw Sharon, David and one of the twins. They had a conversation there. David said, \u2018I know that I left the safe room with two babies, and now I have only one.\u2019 They tried to understand where they lost her, and how.\u00a0",
      "While they were in the back of the truck, soldiers came and started shooting at the terrorists. Either the terrorists were dead or ran away. David, my sister Sharon and the other family, they tried to run or hide. But the babies were crying, so another group of terrorists came and picked them up. And that\u2019s the last thing we know of what happened .\u00a0",
      "In one of the video clips that Hamas shared, we saw David\u2019s face. We think we saw one of my sisters, and maybe her daughter, Emilia, from the back. An army soldier came to us and said they can officially say that all the six are counted as kidnapped. My assumption is that someone found the other twin. That\u2019s the lesser evil of the messages that we can receive. It\u2019s surreal to think that the message that my family was kidnapped was some sort of relief during this time. Other than that, we don\u2019t know their state, we don\u2019t know how they\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re together. I don\u2019t know anything.",

      "Tias\u2019 brother, Elia Cohen, 26, was abducted at the Nova music festival.",
      "I was staying with my mother for the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. We woke up on Saturday morning from the sirens. We live in a neighborhood that rarely gets sirens. If they do get here, they are usually late into a war, so this really surprised us. We decided to just go to the synagogue\u2014at least there we could be with other people who would tell us what is happening. ",
      "People were saying there is a really big crisis going on. There\u2019s rockets all over the country. We heard something about hostages. And we said to ourselves, this doesn\u2019t make any sense. We tried to go ahead with the prayer service but we weren\u2019t really able to pray at all because every minute we would have to go to the shelter and come back. And then during that time there was also a radio, and we heard someone say something about a festival. But it didn\u2019t really occur to me that my brother was there. Of course, I knew that my brother and his girlfriend were at a festival, but we didn\u2019t know that it was the same festival.\u00a0",
      "We gave up on praying because the situation was too scary. Once we got home, the sister of my brother\u2019s girlfriend called my mother and said that there was some kind of attack on the party, but don\u2019t worry there\u2019s a picture of Elia, and he is in the hospital. It\u2019s a famous picture now. But they hadn\u2019t found his girlfriend or her nephew, who was also there with them. We were so stressed, worrying for everyone.",
      "We called up so many hospitals, but nobody had heard my brother\u2019s name anywhere. We called the ambulance, the police, but nobody knew anything.\u00a0",
      "Someone sent my mom a message on Facebook, asking if it was true what she had heard. So my mom asked, \u201cWhat have you heard?\u201d And she told her that Elia was one of the hostages. It didn\u2019t make sense. If he was kidnapped, all the army and police would be here. We managed to talk to his girlfriend, who was at the hospital, but she was really hysterical and couldn\u2019t manage to talk. The social worker at the hospital told us that we should try to call again at a different time.\u00a0",
      "We waited hours and hours, and then tried to call her again. This time she was able to tell us. There were a lot of rockets. They told everyone to leave the festival. They started to pack up and leave, but then someone else called my brother and told him, you can\u2019t go in that direction, along that road\u2014there\u2019s terrorists that are shooting at all the vehicles. Stop, find yourself some cover, run away, but just don\u2019t go near that area. So they entered a bomb shelter with around 30 other people. And they waited for around half an hour, until terrorists from the outside started throwing grenades at them. ",
      "Then, between 10 to 12 terrorists started shooting at everyone inside the bomb shelter, spraying bullets on everyone. The luck of Elia and his girlfriend\u2013I don\u2019t know if you can call it luck\u2013was that they were towards the side of the shelter, so all the bodies fell on them. They were basically buried under the bodies. They managed to hold hands, and they whispered to each other asking if they were OK. Elia told her he was okay, but he was shot in the leg. ",
      "After a couple seconds, they heard screams, and felt that someone was grabbing Elia. And then we connected this story to the picture we had also seen that morning. That picture we had received around 11:00 a.m., so originally we had thought Elia was OK and they were taking care of him. But then we realized that it was a picture that was going around Telegram from Gaza. The army has spoken to us and told us that based on their intelligence, they think he is one of the hostages. We have zero information other than that.  ",
      "This has been one big hell. I want people to understand that we just went through something almost like a Holocaust. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s a Holocaust, but it felt like a Holocaust 2. Something that we never thought in our lives could happen in our country. We always felt protected by the army.\u00a0",
      "But people there did evil things. A terrible massacre\u2014there\u2019s no other way to describe it. To murder kids, parents, babies, old people. To burn houses, to kidnap children. These are not normal things. The level of hatred and lack of humanity it\u2019s beyond understanding. It\u2019s important to me that people know this. We\u2019ve been dealing with this for years and it needs to stop.\u00a0",
      "This is the most important thing. It\u2019s important that people support us, support the nation of Israel. These people were truly innocent. Really young kids. Ages three, four, five. They didn\u2019t do anything to anyone. They don\u2019t need to undergo this horrible trauma.",

      "Ben told Rolling Stone, \"Those 20 months were when [One Direction] went from being on a reality show,\u00a0X Factor,\u00a0to being the biggest-selling artists in the world. That period of time, he was living with us in the most mundane suburban situation. No one ever found out, really.

And per Google\u2019s \u201cFrightgeist\u201d analysis of annual searches for Halloween costumes, Barbie was the overall top search for costumes nationally, while Barbie and Ken dominated searches for couples. Mattel tells TIME that Barbie is the number one costume searched for at Goodwill. On TikTok, searches for \u201cTravis Kelce and Taylor Swift Halloween costume\u201d have garnered nearly 427 million views, while \u201cBarbie and Ken Halloween costume ideas\u201d has racked up over 241 million views, with hundreds of videos of users showing off their costumes or making tutorials on how to recreate the looks.",

      "Unsurprisingly so: Barbie was a box office hit with a ubiquitous marketing campaign and countless merchandise collaborations, and Swift\u2019s Eras tour broke attendance and tickets sales records, while her high-profile romance with Kelce has only increased her momentum, most recently resulting in Saturday Night Live cameos for the couple. But their popularity also points to a cultural fascination with the \u201call-American\u201d couple, a concept whose most dominant interpretation is a specific reading of convention\u2014that is, white, straight, and monogamous. ",
      "\u201cBarbie and Taylor Swift are emblematic symbols of a specific kind of American femininity,\" says sexologist and dating coach Myisha Battle. \"Both [couples] are hyper representations of masculinity and femininity.\u201d",
      "This surge in interest in dressing as both couples marks a fascinating response to shifting views on marriage and relationships, she says. A September 2023 Pew Research survey found that 71% of Americans think that a job or career they enjoy is important to have a fulfilling life, compared to the 23% who believe that a marriage will lead to a fulfilling life. The face of marriage is also changing; Pew reports that since the 1970s, the number of Americans in an interracial or interethnic marriage has risen from 4% to 16% and that since same-sex marriages have become legal nationally in 2015, the number of same sex marriages had increased by over 60%.  ",

      "\u201cPeople might feel comforted by hearkening back to a time where whiteness and heteronormativity were the accepted standard,\u201d says Battle. \u201cWhat better way to to get to that end goal of an all-American nuclear family than to be a heterosexual couple? For people who are cisgender or heterosexual, this is a way to sort of reclaim that identity in a really public way. That\u2019s scary and spooky\u2014it\u2019s appropriate for Halloween.\u201d",
      "There's also the element of projected nostalgia, adds Darnell-Jamal Lisby, a fashion historian and \u200b\u200ban assistant curator of fashion at the Cleveland Museum of Art. ",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a fantasy about that, which is why it\u2019s not surprising people would emulate it with a costume,\u201d he says. \u201cMy question is intention\u2014someone like Taylor represents a reinforcement of a world that they may have once been attached to, a world that wasn\u2019t as politically correct or that was as diverse.\u201d ",
      "For Jerome McLeod, a 31-year-old manager in New York, dressing up as Ken this Halloween is less of an embrace of what the doll has long represented and more of a subversion of it. McLeod, who\u2019s planning on donning a blonde wig with an \u201cI am Kenough\u201d tie-dye sweatshirt for his look, decided to dress up as Ken after seeing the Barbie movie this summer, where he says he was inspired by its \u201cirony of embracing convention, while critiquing systems.\u201d That\u2014and he was eager to have a costume that would be easily identified.",
      "\u201cInstant recognition\u2014that\u2019s all I really want,\u201d he says. ",

      "\u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d has still proved to be a movie event unlike any other. ",
      "NEW YORK -- In a movie match-up almost as unlikely as \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d Martin Scorsese took on Taylor Swift in cinemas over the weekend. And while the box office belonged for a second time to \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\u201d Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d got off to a strong start in Apple Studios\u2019 first major theatrical gambit.",
      "After a record-breaking opening weekend of $92.8 million, \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d took in an estimated $31 million over the weekend from 3,855 locations, according to AMC Theaters. In an unconventional deal, the theater chain is distributing Swift\u2019s concert film, and playing it only Thursdays through Sundays.",
      "Most Swifties rushed to see the film on opening weekend, when a large percent of sales were driven by advance ticketing. Sales dropped a steep 67% in its second weekend, potentially signifying that \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d was predominantly an opening-weekend phenomenon.",
      "But \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d has still proved to be a movie event unlike any other. Within days, it became the highest grossing concert film ever in North America, not accounting for inflation. It\u2019s quickly accumulated $129.8 million domestically.",
      "More was riding on \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d a historical crime drama about a string of murders against the Osage nation in the early 1920s. The film, which cost at least $200 million to make, is the largest production yet from Apple Studios. The streamer partnered with Paramount Pictures to release Scorsese\u2019s adaptation of David Grann\u2019s bestseller in 3,628 theaters, with plans to later stream it on a not-yet-announced date on Apple TV+.",
      "\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d debuted with $23 million, marking the third best opening for the 80-year-old Scorsese, following \u201cShutter Island\u201d ($41 million in 2010) and \u201cThe Departed\u201d ($26.9 million in 2006). Though Scorsese\u2019s latest opus, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro, will have a hard road to reaching profitability, it\u2019s a successful launch for a 206-minute-long adult-skewing drama \u2013 a type of movie that, outside \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d has struggled mightily at the box office in recent years.",
      "And \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d with rave reviews, an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore from audiences and the backing of a robust Oscar campaign, should continue to play well over the long haul. It added $21 million overseas.",
      "\u201cKiller of the Flower Moon\u201d also marks the best wide-release debut for a film from a streaming company. While Netflix (which backed Scorsese\u2019s last narrative feature, \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d in 2019) has charted a mostly limited approach to theatrical release, Apple and Amazon, which last year closed its purchase of MGM, have pursued more expansive theatrical strategies.",
      "Earlier this year, Apple said it plans to spend $1 billion a year making movies that will have theatrical releases before reaching its streaming service. Apple is also behind Ridley Scott\u2019s upcoming \u201cNapoleon,\u201d with Joaquin Phoenix, which Sony Pictures will distribute Nov. 22; and has partnered with Universal for Matthew Vaughn\u2019s \u201cArgylle,\u201d due out Feb. 2.",
      "Paramount had initially signed on to produce and distribute \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d but transitioned into the deal with Apple when costs of project \u2014 shot during the pandemic \u2014 rose.",
      "\u201cIf \u2018flexibility\u2019 is the new mantra of the theatrical movie business, then this is a significant success \u2014 it establishes a viable option for the companies,\u201d David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, said of the \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d launch.",
      "As dissimilar as \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d and \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d are, they\u2019re alike in their extended run times. A double feature of the weekend\u2019s top two movies would have taken six hours and 14 minutes, not counting ads and trailers.",
      "\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\" also reeled in more young moviegoers than one might have expected. Paramount said 44% of ticket buyers were under the age of 30.",
      "\u201cExorcist: The Believer,\u201d the horror sequel directed by David Gordon Green, came in a distant third with $5.6 million in its third weekend of release. The Universal, Blumhouse film has grossed $54.2 million domestically.",
      "\u201cPAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie\u201d came in at No. 4 with $4.5 million in its fourth weekend. The fifth spot went to the rerelease of Tim Burton's \u201cThe Nightmare Before Christmas,\u201d which collected $4.1 million 30 years after it first landed in theaters. ",

      "When Taylor Swift announced that her Eras Tour film would be opening a day early, \"we were in this mad rush to get everything ready,\" Shane, a manager of a small-town movie theater in the Pacific Northwest, said.",
      "\"It was good that we did get people in the theater and I guess made sure everything worked all the way through. I don't know what we would've done if it was a 250-person sellout,\" he said. Insider verified his full name and employment, but withheld them over privacy concerns.",
      "While the crowd wasn't too much to handle, the sound was: The movie was so loud that it's blown out two amplifiers.",
      "\"The first time we did a test play, one of our amplifiers blew up and killed a theater, which is wonderful,\" he said. On Sunday night, another one blew out. Neither have been able to be replaced yet.",
      "\"We were instructed to turn it up fairly loud. They said they wanted it to be a true concert experience,\" he said.",
      "Swift's Eras Tour film is already record-smashing, bringing in between $95 and $97 million and marking the biggest-ever opening of a concert film \u2014 and is now in the running to potentially have the strongest-ever October debut. And while some Swifties were boisterous during the movie, taking to the aisles to scream, sing, and dance, that wasn't the case for everyone.",
      "At Shane's theater, crowds were pretty standard for a weekend night, with some staff even sent home because it wasn't as busy as they feared it would be. The Swifties who came were \"really hyped for it,\" Shane said, and definitely discussing their excitement, but seemed to really be there to absorb the concert experience.",
      "\"One of the showings had only two people in it, and we have to check the theater every 25, 30 minutes to make sure nobody's recording or standing on the seats or doing anything like that,\" he said. \"And they were just sitting down and watching it.\"",
      "The Swifties were also focused when it came to, what, exactly they were buying beyond tickets. While the theater had a \"good amount\" of sales of the branded popcorn buckets and cups released for the film, other concessions weren't selling as well as they normally do, Shane said. The Swifties just wanted their merch. But overall, it was a pretty good crowd \u2014 albeit a little disappointing that it was smaller than expected.",
      "\"Honestly, compared to all of the kids movies and horror movies that are out right now, the Taylor Swift fans are not bad at all. They don't really leave that big of a mess other than, I don't know, the occasional spilled drink or the occasional little spill of popcorn,\" Shane said.",
      "In kids movies, he said, you \"find tons of popcorn everywhere, tons of candy everywhere, four or five spilled drinks in a theater.\" After an Eras Tour screening, \"you don't really find anything too awful.\"",
      "Broadly, he wants Eras Tour theatergoers to know that even if they've purchased tickets online, they'll still need to be scanned. That's been a friction point for all movie goers, for whatever reason.",
      "\"Honestly, I hope this concert style film doesn't become super popular \u2014 because amps aren't cheap,\" he said.",

      "On a sunny fall day, I arrived at the theatre in my city an hour before the matinee showing of Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour movie. I was the only one there.\u00a0",
      "The teenager behind the concession asked if I wanted to \"go for a walk\" to kill the time.",
      "I wasn't overzealous for going so early \u2014 it was opening weekend, after all. In the big cities, gangs of giddy girls dressed in different \"Era\" outfits lined city blocks to see Swift's tour in two-dimensional form. But in the Caprice movie theatre in Duncan, B.C., I sat alone. An old dude in a neglected theatre.",
      "Being alone inside The Caprice was unsettling. It's not retro by design; it's retro by depression. The rundown lobby smells like popcorn, plumbing and motel mornings. I genuinely wish it had the \"aw, shucks\" charm of a small-town movie house. But no. It feels more like a building to hole up in, shotgun in hand, ready to fight off zombies.",
      "The theatre did eventually fill up. A lot of girls in costume, escorted by enthusiastic moms or reluctant dads. There were birthday parties jacked up on sugar. Adult BFFs in Taylor tees. A couple of crying babies. By the time the lights dimmed, the theatre was more than half-full, and I felt a little less bananas for being there.",
      "Just before Taylor appeared on screen, the mother beside me asked her son, \"Poo-poo or pee-pee? Quick, which one?\"",
      "A good question, seeing as The Eras Tour is an almost three-hour epic that encapsulates a singer's entire catalogue. That's a lot of Taylor Swift.",
      "Why did I go to The Eras Tour movie by myself? Truthfully, I'm new to Vancouver Island, so I don't have many friends I can ask out to a Sunday matinee, let alone to a marathon of Taylor Swift breakup songs.",
      "But I'm also a sucker for concert movies. As a TV director, I revel in seeing how these spectacles are executed. And like most of the population, I genuinely like Taylor Swift. Folklore is constantly in my headphones.",
      "But the real motive was to experience the movie at the same time my daughters did in a city around 460 kilometres away. I had promised them, and it felt like a meaningful and creative way to bond with my two girls from afar.",
      "My daughters, now in their teens, have lived in Kelowna, B.C., with their mom for over a decade following the end of my marriage. Lily and Willa are only a half-day drive away, and I visit often. Yet, I hear them more than I see them.",
      "It's because I've religiously phoned them every suppertime since they were in diapers. It's an evening ritual I keep to this day.",
      "Being a long-distance dad doesn't have to be a melancholic fate. Of course, I wish I had brought them up in person and the gifts I mail are no substitute. Still, our daddy-daughter relationship is fully realized, effervescent and alive \u2014 even if, technically, we are now separated by the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Watching Taylor Swift's evolution on the big screen was a clear allegory for the evolution of our father-daughter journey. The world watched Taylor grow up at the same time I watched Lily and Willa grow up, and we listened to her music together; each different era of Swift's was a unique era for the three of us.",
      "The bazillion-dollar concert film started as a sheer spectacle, but soon settled into a kind of hushed personal experience, much like flipping through a photo album.",
      "Watching Swift sing the oldies, I was transported to Kelowna visits for our marathon dance parties and singalongs inside our minivan with the volume cranked to the max. And when Taylor released her new material, I took pride that Lily and Willa texted me their favourite songs during each album's release. That they love pushing their music on me \u2014 like I push my music on them\u00a0 \u2014 is DNA in action.",
      "When I got home, I received a text from the girls' mom. It was a photo of my youngest, Willa, in a Red era outfit, ready for the same Sunday matinee I went to, around 460 kilometres away. Lily decided she wanted to go a week later with her own decked-out Swiftie sisterhood.",
      "After we'd all seen it, we got on the phone. And the three of us compared notes, ranked the songs and laughed together at the costumes people in the audience had worn at our respective theatres.",
      "It was one marvellous call.",

      "\n      If you think about it, 2023 is shaping up to be the year that blonde women bailed out the movie industry, with Taylor Swift\u2019s concert film, \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\u201d providing a shot of adrenaline to the fall after \u201cBarbie\u201d helped offset several high-profile flops during the summer.\n  ",
      "\n      While theater owners have every right to be thrilled seeing people fill seats (or even dancing in front of them, per \u201cEras\u201d etiquette), the highs associated with those standouts don\u2019t provide enough of a boost to replace what they really need \u2013 namely, a steady drip of hits. So while the this fall harvest is surely welcome, as is so often true, a Swift solution isn\u2019t likely to be an enduring one.\n  ",
      "\nAdvance sales for \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d left little doubt that the event would be a major success, leaving only the precise numbers in doubt. Collecting somewhere around $96 million in domestic release, per theater chain AMC\u2019s estimates, its first three days in theaters shattered the overall record for any concert film.\n  ",
      "\n      Among other things, as Deadline reported, thanks to \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d the aggregate weekend tally for theaters in North America rose to its highest level since early August, when \u2013 ta-da \u2013 \u201cBarbie\u201d was still packing them in, with an assist from \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d\n  ",
      "\n      The film grossed more than $30 million elsewhere around the globe, with $13 million coming on Imax screens \u2013 the kind of numbers, its CEO said in a statement, \u201cusually reserved for Hollywood blockbusters.\u201d\n  ",
      "\n      Credit theaters with creativity, as the Swift invasion and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s upcoming version of the Renaissance Tour amount to taking matters into their own hands at a time when studios have struggled \u2013 even with big-name franchises \u2013 to consistently deliver attractions that will overcome the headwinds associated with streaming and the pandemic.\n  ",
      "\n      Those titles, however, have the feeling of a sugar rush, with short-lived benefits, which doesn\u2019t address the underlying problem or the general malaise assailing the theatrical business.\n  ",
      "\n      In that sense, the next blonde hero flying to the rescue might be more important: Brie Larson, a.k.a. Captain Marvel, whose sequel \u201cThe Marvels\u201d hits theaters on November 10. After Disney\u2019s recent stumbles at the box office \u2013 with underwhelming returns for \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d and \u201cHaunted Mansion\u201d \u2013 seeing a big-budgeted Marvel movie buoy the fall would be a welcome return to better days.\n  ",
      "\n      Even Marvel, though, offers no certainty of success, as \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\u201d got its next phase of movies off to at best a so-so start, before the third \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d blasted its way to an $845 million global box-office haul, making it one of the clear bright spots in an otherwise uneven year.\n  ",
      "\nBeyonc\u00e9 announces 'Renaissance' concert film with new trailer\n",
      "\n      As if the climate for movies weren\u2019t uncertain enough, the studios have done themselves no favors by allowing the strikes by the writers and actors guilds (the former settled, the latter still in progress) to drag on as long as they have, forcing them to juggle release schedules in order to avoid theatrical deserts next spring.\n  ",
      "\n      Studios will eventually catch up, but if we\u2019ve seen anything over the last three years, any development that even temporarily blunts the willingness and desire to go to the movies offers no assurances of recovering those losses with so much streaming content spread out before consumers.\n  ",
      "\n      Like \u201cBarbie,\u201d \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d already appears to have provoked a certain giddiness in distribution circles, providing evidence, as TV networks like to say when they pop a big rating, that \u201cThe pipes still work\u201d in terms of the ability to deliver mass-viewing experiences.\n  ",
      "\n      Still, there aren\u2019t many artists with the kind of followings that Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 command. That alone isn\u2019t reason to throw cold water on the celebration, merely a reminder that with a challenge of this magnitude, Hollywood can\u2019t just shake it off.\n  ",

      "Taylor Swift and the NFL have a closer relationship than ever, and even TV executives are in on it.\u00a0",
      "Mark Marshall, NBCUniversal\u2019s new ad chairman, name-checked Taylor Swift in his first public appearance since replacing Linda Yaccarino, now CEO of X, formerly Twitter. He described helping Swift sell tickets to Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, a film that premiered last Friday and shows her performing for nearly three hours in concert.\u00a0",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no bigger brand in the world than Taylor Swift, and she still needed help to actually sell [movie] tickets,\u201d he said at the Advertising Week conference in New York on Tuesday. The help, in part, was delivered by the NFL.\u00a0",
      "Several weeks ago, Swift\u2019s film distributor, AMC, contacted NBCUniversal-owned Fandango for help selling tickets to the new movie, Marshall said. Swift had bypassed the traditional Hollywood studios by producing the film herself and inking a distribution deal directly with AMC. Swifties had quickly bought up tickets for the first two weekends of her movie as they had for her concerts, Marshall said, but advance ticket sales dropped off noticeably for the following weeks. AMC wanted to fix that, he said.\u00a0",
      "In the end, NBCUniversal ran four commercials for the film\u2014two during The Voice singing competition show and two during NFL Sunday Night Football on Oct. 1, a game that Swift attended. During the game, announcers also mentioned the film as part of their on-air commentary. Fandango\u2019s average daily sales rose 50% following just those four commercials, Marshall said.\u00a0",
      "The NFL had also asked networks to show Swift\u2019s movie commercials for free, the New York Post previously reported. NBC aired the ads, though the ad slots were paid for, the company confirmed to Fortune. ",
      "Over the past weekend, Swift\u2019s film brought in $92.8 million in U.S. box office sales, breaking the record for a concert movie premiere in North America. Theaters keep 43% of revenues, while Swift and AMC split the rest, the majority going to the artist, Fortune reported.\u00a0",
      "At the conference on Tuesday, Marshall\u2019s comment that Swift \u201cstill needed help to sell tickets\u201d was meant as a sales pitch to advertisers in the room rather than as a jab at the artist\u2019s box office appeal. Marshall, who was promoted in August after nearly 10 years at the company, joked he now knows what \u201cSwiftie\u201d means\u2014a loyal fan and follower of Taylor Swift.",
      "Swift and the NFL have been inseparable lately following rumors that the singer is dating Travis Kelce, a Kansas City Chiefs tight end. She has attended a handful of games, sitting in a box next to Kelce\u2019s mom, Donna Kelce, and alongside celebrities like Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Sophie Turner.\u00a0",
      "The NFL and the networks that broadcast its games have eagerly played along with the relationship in an effort to win over Swift\u2019s huge fan base (and the money that comes with them). The networks have given the Eras superstar valuable screen time during the games and created a pregame explainer giving context to the teams and season for new viewers. They also featured her \u201cWelcome to New York\u201d on air. In return, the broadcasters have enjoyed increased viewership while the NFL has benefited from more ticket and merchandise sales.",
      "Correction, October 18, 2023:\u00a0A previous version of this article misstated the source of increased ticket sales for Taylor Swift\u2019s film following TV commercials. It was Fandango.",

It was expected to pull in $105 million to $145 million, according to tracker\u00a0Boxoffice Pro. The shortfall reflects the difficulty in predicting box office receipts for an unusual release like the Swift movie.",
      "\u201cVariables such as average ticket price, assessing how frontloaded Swift\u2019s fan base would make the film\u2019s presales, and whether or not any traditional marketing would bring out non-Swifties all weighed heavily on the wide range of possible outcomes,\u201d Shawn Robbins, chief analyst for Boxoffice Pro, said in an email. \u201cSwift, her fans, and the theatrical exhibition industry should all be celebrating the results.\u201d",

The\u00a0previous record\u00a0was held by\u00a0Justin Bieber:\u00a0Never Say Never.\u00a0That 2011 movie, distributed by Paramount Pictures, brought in $29.5 million in its opening weekend. Jackson\u2019s\u00a0This Is It\u00a0registered $23.2 million in 2009.",
      "Jackson\u2019s movie went on to gross $261 million globally during its entire run in theaters, while the Bieber film brought in $99 million.",
      "Rather than distribute\u00a0The Eras Tour\u00a0movie through a studio, Swift struck a deal with AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., the largest theater operator. Other chains will get the picture through Variance Films, an independent distributor. Swift and AMC are expected to take home 57% of the box-office sales, according to the Puck website.\u00a0",
      "After Swift announced the movie in August, advance ticket sales at AMC\u00a0set\u00a0a single-day record. Originally slated to open Oct. 13, the release was moved up a day due to increased demand.\u00a0",
      "She promoted the film heavily, including\u00a0surprise appearances\u00a0by both Swift and her reputed boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce, on\u00a0Saturday Night Live, and a cover story in the Sunday New York Times magazine this weekend.",
      "Swift\u2019s movie offered an opportunity for fans, known as Swifties, to catch the show they missed or relive the concert experience. Noor Jahan, 26, saw Swift live, but was happy to take her 13-year-old sister and 16-year-old cousin to the movie this week. The family wore matching heart-shaped sunglasses and cardigans and traded friendship bracelets with movie goers at a screening in New York.\u00a0",
      "\u201cI was there for Taylor and singing the songs I grew up listening to, but now I can see the dancers and the production and details she puts in,\u201d Jahan said. She said the movie experience was similar to the concert with fans screaming, signing and dancing.\u00a0",
      "Her sister, Shamira, called the film \u201ceverything she wanted and more.\u201d",
      "Critics loved the picture as much as the Swifties, with the film getting a perfect score of 100 among movie critics on Rotten Tomatoes.\u00a0",

      "Most Swifties rushed to see the film on opening weekend, when a large percent of sales were driven by advance ticketing. Sales dropped a steep 67% in its second weekend, potentially signifying that \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d was predominantly an opening-weekend phenomenon.",
      "But \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d has still proved to be a movie event unlike any other. Within days, it became the highest grossing concert film ever in North America, not accounting for inflation. It\u2019s quickly accumulated $129.8 million domestically.",
      "More was riding on\u00a0\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d\u00a0a historical crime drama about a string of murders against the Osage nation in the early 1920s. The film, which cost at least $200 million to make, is the largest production yet from Apple Studios. The streamer partnered with Paramount Pictures to release Scorsese\u2019s adaptation of David Grann\u2019s bestseller in 3,628 theaters, with plans to later stream it on a not-yet-announced date on Apple TV+.",
      "\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d debuted with $23 million, marking the third best opening for the 80-year-old Scorsese, following \u201cShutter Island\u201d ($41 million in 2010) and \u201cThe Departed\u201d ($26.9 million in 2006). Though Scorsese\u2019s latest opus, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro, will have a hard road to reaching profitability, it\u2019s a successful launch for a 206-minute-long adult-skewing drama \u2013 a type of movie that,\u00a0outside \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d\u00a0has struggled mightily at the box office in recent years.",

      "The North American box office had one of its slowest weekends of the year, due in large part to \u201cDune: Part Two\u2019s\u201d absence from the lineup.",
      "Moviegoers had many other options to choose from. The video game adaptation \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d repeated its first-place ranking, followed by\u00a0\u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d\u00a0still going strong.\u00a0Sofia Coppola\u2019s \u201cPriscilla\u00a0\u201d expanded nationwide and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d returned to IMAX screens. Several well-received indies opened as well.",
      "But this was the weekend that Warner Bros. and Legendary\u2019s \u201c\u00a0Dune: Part Two\u201d was supposed to open, before the\u00a0SAG-AFTRA strike\u00a0prompted many studios to shuffle release dates in anticipation of\u00a0a lengthy dispute\u00a0that has stopped movie stars from promoting their films. The \u201cDune\u201d sequel starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya was pushed to March 2024, and no major blockbusters moved in to take its Nov. 3 spot.",
      "Even with \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d still bringing Swifties to the multiplex, and prestige offerings including Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d and Alexander Payne\u2019s \u201cThe Holdovers,\u201d overall ticket sales are likely to be around $64 million for the weekend, making it one of the slowest of the year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to reverse engineer, but \u2018Dune 2\u2019 would have certainly been the No. 1 movie and it would have been a bigger overall weekend,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cThe strikes have had a profound impact on this marketplace. But this left a lot of opportunity for films like \u2018Priscilla,\u2019 \u2018The Holdovers\u2019 and \u2018Radical\u2019 to get more of a spotlight.\u201d",
      "In its second weekend, \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d picked up an additional $19.4 million to take first place, according to studio estimates Sunday. It\u2019s a hefty\u00a076% drop from its first weekend. That\u2019s not unexpected given that the movie is also streaming on Peacock and that viewership for films targeting intense and niche fandoms are often wildly frontloaded. But taking in $217 million globally against a reported $20 million production budget makes it a hit for Universal Pictures and Blumhouse.",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d took second place, with fourth weekend earnings at an estimated $13.5 million for the AMC release. Playing only on Thursdays through Sundays, the film has made an astonishing $231.1 million globally to date.",
      "In third place, \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d was down only 25% in its third weekend, with $7 million from 3,786 screens, which brings its domestic total to $52.3 million. The $200 million film was financed by Apple Original Films with Paramount overseeing its theatrical run.",
      "After a healthy opening in New York and Los Angeles last weekend, \u201cPriscilla,\u201d based on Priscilla Presley\u2019s 1985 memoir \u201cElvis and Me,\u201d expanded to 1,359 screens where it earned $5.1 million over the weekend to take fourth place. Coppola\u2019s\u00a0well reviewed film starring Cailee Spaeny and Jacob Elordi\u00a0attracted an audience that was predominately younger (75% under 35) and female (65%). The hope is that A24 release will have a long life into awards season.",
      "\u201c\u00a0The Holdovers,\u201d a Focus Features release, also expanded slightly to 64 theaters this weekend, where it grossed an additional $600,000. Next weekend the New England-set period drama starring Paul Giamatti as a curmudgeonly prep school teacher will expand to over 800 locations.",
      "A handful of smaller films made their theatrical debuts this weekend, including\u00a0Meg Ryan\u2019s \u201cWhat Happens Later,\u201d\u00a0released by Bleecker Street; and Sundance gems \u201c\u00a0Radical\u00a0\u201d and \u201c\u00a0All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt.\u201d",
      "The biggest of the batch was \u201c\u00a0Radical,\u201d which is based on a true story about a teacher in a Mexican border city and stars Eugenio Derbez. The warmly reviewed Pantelion release opened in 419 locations and made $2.7 million.",
      "\u201c\u2019Radical\u2019 is a big winner this weekend and a big win for Eugenio Derbez,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cHe\u2019s becoming a global superstar.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat Happens Later,\u201d a rom-com starring Ryan and David Duchovny as exes stuck in an airport, made $1.6 million from 1,492 screens. Raven Jackson\u2019s \u201cAll Dirt Roads Taste of Salt,\u201d meanwhile, opened on three screens and earned $12,529, according to A24.",
      "\u201cThe overall box office is rather quiet, but there are so many interesting films out there,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cIndependent film can really shine right now.\u201d",
      "The effects of the ongoing strike at the box office are not easily quantifiable. Up to this point, it\u2019s mainly meant that stars without interim agreements haven\u2019t been able to promote their films. \u201cPriscilla\u201d was one of the exceptions and Elordi and Spaeny have been able to do interviews and appear on talk shows to drum up awareness.",
      "Next weekend will be an interesting test, as\u00a0Marvel and Disney release \u201cThe Marvels\u201d\u00a0without months of appearances from stars like Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris and Lashana Lynch preceding it. It is possible a resolution between the actors\u2019 guild and the major entertainment companies may come this week, but it\u2019s unclear if that will have any impact on \u201cThe Marvels.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll eyes will be on \u2018The Marvels,\u2019 not only what it represents during the strikes, but what it means for Marvel as a whole, which is always compared to their past successes,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cBut the opening weekend isn\u2019t everything anymore. Hopefully it\u2019ll provide an infusion of that blockbuster feeling going into the holiday season.\u201d",

      "Since 2008\u2019s \u201cIron Man,\u201d the Marvel machine has been one of the most unstoppable forces in box-office history. Now, though, that aura of invincibility is showing signs of wear and tear. The superhero factory hit a new low with the weekend launch of \u201cThe Marvels,\u201d which opened with just $47 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "The 33rd installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a sequel to the 2019 Brie Larson-led \u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d managed less than a third of the $153.4 million its predecessor launched with before ultimately taking in $1.13 billion worldwide.",
      "Sequels, especially in Marvel Land, aren\u2019t supposed to fall off a cliff. Yet \u201cThe Marvels\u201d debuted with more than $100 million less than \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d opened with \u2014 something no sequel before has ever done. David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Research Entertainment, called it \u201can unprecedented Marvel box-office collapse.\u201d",
      "The previous low for a Walt Disney Co.-owned Marvel movie was \u201cAnt-Man,\u201d which bowed with $57.2 million in 2015. Otherwise, you have to go outside the Disney MCU to find such a slow start for a Marvel movie \u2014 releases like Universal\u2019s \u201cThe Incredible Hulk\u201d with $55.4 million in 2008, Sony\u2019s \u201cMorbius\u201d with $39 million in 2022 or 20th Century Fox\u2019s \u201cFantastic Four\u201d reboot with $25.6 million in 2015.",
      "But \u201cThe Marvels\u201d was a $200 million-plus sequel to a billion-dollar blockbuster. It was also an exceptional Marvel release in numerous ways. The film,\u00a0directed by Nia DaCosta,\u00a0was the first MCU release directed by a Black woman. It was also the rare Marvel movie led by three women \u2014 Larson, Teyonah Parris and Iman Vellani.",
      "Reviews weren\u2019t strong\u00a0(62% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and neither was audience reaction. \u201cThe Marvels\u201d is only the third MCU release to receive a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore from moviegoers, following\u00a0\u201cEternals\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantamania.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Marvels,\u201d which added $63.3 million in overseas ticket sales, may go down as a turning point in the MCU. Over the years, the franchise has collected $33 billion globally \u2014 a point Disney noted in reporting its grosses Sunday.",
      "But with movie screens and streaming platforms increasingly crowded with superhero films and series, some analysts have detected a new fatigue setting in for audiences. Disney chief executive Bob Iger himself has spoken about possible oversaturation for Marvel.",
      "\u201cOver the last three and a half years, the growth of the genre has stopped,\u201d Gross wrote in a newsletter Sunday.",
      "Either way, something is shifting for superheroes. The box-office crown this year appears assured to go to \u201cBarbie,\u201d\u00a0the year\u2019s biggest smash\u00a0with more than $1.4 billion worldwide for Warner Bros.",
      "Marvel has still produced recent hits.\u00a0\u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\u201d\u00a0launched this summer with $118 million before ultimately raking in $845.6 million worldwide. Sony\u2019s\u00a0\u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d\u00a0earned $690.5 million globally and, after rave reviews, is widely expected to be an Oscar contender.",
      "The actors strike also didn\u2019t do \u201cThe Marvels\u201d any favors. The cast of the film weren\u2019t permitted to promote the film until\u00a0the strike was called off\u00a0late Wednesday evening when SAG-AFTRA and the studios reached agreement. Larson and company quickly jumped onto social media and made surprise appearances in theaters. And Larson guested on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d on Friday.",
      "The normally orderly pattern of MCU releases has also been disrupted by the strikes. After numerous strike-related delays, the only Marvel movie currently on the studio\u2019s 2024 calendar is \u201cDeadpool 3,\u201d opening July 26.",
      "Separately, after\u00a0two weeks atop the box office,\u00a0Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d slid to second place with $9 million in its third weekend of release. The Blumhouse-produced videogame adaptation has accumulated $127.2 million domestically.",
      "Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d concert film\u00a0came in third with $5.9 million from 2,484 venues in its fifth weekend of release. The film, produced by Swift and distributed by AMC Theatres, has made $172.5 million domestically and $240.9 million worldwide.",
      "Sofia Coppola\u2019s \u201cPriscilla\u201d\u00a0held strongly in its second weekend of wide release. The A24 film, starring Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla Presley and Jacob Elordi as Elvis, remained in fourth place with $4.8 million, dipping only 5% from the week prior.",
      "Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d\u00a0an Apple Studios production being theatrically distributed by Paramount Pictures, took in $4.7 million on its fourth weekend, to bring its domestic haul to about $60 million. While quite low for a $200 million movie, \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d is primarily an awards-season statement by Apple of its growing moviemaking ambitions.",
      "In its first weekend of expanded release,\u00a0Alexander Payne\u2019s acclaimed \u201cThe Holdovers,\u201d\u00a0starring Paul Giamatti as a curmudgeonly boarding-school instructor, launched with $3.2 million from 778 locations.

      "Taylor Swift looms, bedazzled and behemoth, in all her filmed-in-IMAX glory.",
      "My left ear is ringing, pummeled by the bass blasting from the supersize speakers. Kids are screaming at such a pitch that my \u201cchild is in peril, ACT NOW\u201d button keeps getting punched, but no, they\u2019re not hurt, just excited. This is a movie theater in suburban New Jersey, during the noon matinee of \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d on Saturday of opening weekend. Front-facing cameras abound, remembering this moment. Thousands of friendship bracelets adorn hundreds of wrists. A duo wears matching pink, feathered cowboy hats and custom T-shirts.",
      "I feel reasonably sure that when Taylor Swift sang, \u201cI wanna be your endgame,\u201d she wasn\u2019t talking about the Avengers film bearing the same subtitle. But the release of Swift\u2019s concert film really is the pop music equivalent of when Marvel\u2019s Avengers finally, finally assembled on screen after decades of buildup. Welcome to the Taylor Swift Cinematic Universe \u2014 we\u2019re all just players in its decades-spanning arc. \u201cEras\u201d raked in $92.8 million in North American box office earnings on its opening weekend, breezing past the (now) No. 2 all-time concert film opening, \u201cJustin Bieber: Never Say Never,\u201d with its $29.5 million. It\u2019s the second-biggest October movie opening ever, regardless of genre.",
      "Sure, without the context of obsessive fandom, you\u2019d still have a fun time at \u201cEras,\u201d in which Swift plays songs from all 10 of her studio albums, but as with Iron Man and associates, there are surprises and hidden meanings in store that spike heart rates and reward rewatches: Here\u2019s Kobe Bryant\u2019s second-youngest daughter, receiving the relic known to Swifties as \u201cthe \u201822\u2019 hat.\u201d There\u2019s Swift\u2019s manicure with a different color on each nail to represent each of her studio albums. Speaking of her hands, did you see that the microphones were all decorated for the different eras?",
      "It\u2019s no coincidence that searches for \u201cEras Tour post-credits scene\u201d spiked on opening weekend \u2014 fans were just that convinced that Taylor had one more sly hint to share, maybe a bonus track or announcement of the next (Taylor\u2019s Version) recording, perhaps a secret code that can be deciphered into a love note or shout-out.",
      "Speaking of \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d Swift channels some of that Thanos \u201cfine, I\u2019ll do it myself\u201d energy of her own. This is not to say she\u2019s a villain, more that Thanos is an effective character because he had a point. After all, when she re-records her older albums so she can own the masters for her own songs, alchemizes a misplaced piece of knitwear into a short-film directorial credit and a Grammy, or acts as an avenging angel for Sophie Turner and her daughters amid a messy divorce, how different is her vibe from Thanos\u2019s begrudging shouldering of the mantle to restore balance to the universe? The fan relationship with Swift is parasocial, sure, but in an age plagued with loneliness, in our desperate search to be seen, Swift looks squarely, solidly back. Her TikTok comments, messages to fans both coded and direct, and even literal invitations to her apartment in the past, make a global phenomenon feel personal, intimate even. Swift knows that we\u2019re all looking at her, but she signals that she really sees us, a devastatingly basic and universal desire.",
      "Thanos wanted to wipe out half of humanity for a hard reset, but Swift wants to save our humanity. She\u2019s here to save us all from ourselves.",
      "Back in April, I was fortunate enough to catch a date of the Eras Tour live, in Atlanta, thanks to a twist of luck and a generous friend. The set list for the concert I saw live and the filmed one were largely the same, so the experience was familiar, but entirely different at the same time. For one thing, at the concert, I sang \u201c22\u201d with three women I\u2019d gone to college with, people with whom I had actually been 22, in all its messy fabulosity and angst. A decade-plus later, at the movie, my 5-year-old daughter slid in and out of my lap throughout the nearly three-hour runtime. \u201cMommy, is the recital happening right now?\u201d she asked me, wide-eyed. In the past, she\u2019s earnestly informed me, \u201cI\u2019d like to meet Taylor Swift someday. I think she\u2019d like me.\u201d",
      "Swift is that rare artist who\u2019s been rolling along, picking up new fans and keeping the old, during her long career. Just as Taylor has reinvented herself, giving some lyrics little tweaks in her re-recordings, different iterations of me, and everyone, have had our own evolutions. I have not only (Mommy\u2019s Version), but also (Oh, Wow, This Internship Is Almost Over\u2019s Version), (Do I Move to the Burbs\u2019 Version), (Should I Get Bangs\u2019 Version) and (I Miss Skinny Jeans\u2019 Version). She\u2019s at our weddings, graduations, parties, nondescript Tuesday afternoons that all melt together in memory but happened nonetheless, and were therefore important. Let it be important, and don\u2019t devalue it, with that familiar whiff of sexism or cultural burnout or, sure, maybe both. Regardless, Eras is a canon event as etched into the cultural consciousness as Spider-Man\u2019s Uncle Ben dying, or the Hulk smashing whatever it is he\u2019s currently smashing.",
      "There is no shortage of content in the world, and everywhere I turn, it feels as though someone\u2019s very favorite thing is something I\u2019ve literally never heard of. Taylor Swift, however, is as inescapable as Captain America once was, a million-bajillion-dollar cultural juggernaut for today, a generation-spanning fascination with all the obsessive cataloguing, theorizing and debate that comes with it (not to mention the awe-inspiring amount of spandex they both deploy). Who says the monoculture is dead? Fan or no, everyone has an opinion, an experience, a story to share, even if it\u2019s grumbling that you can\u2019t watch a football game these days without her performing celebratory chest-bump choreography, which sounds a lot like grouchy cinephiles blaming Marvel for \u201cruining movies.\u201d",

Violence is frequent and can be intense: Expect guns and shooting, many deaths (both violently and from illness), gory dead bodies, blood spatters, explosions, abductions, beatings, suggestions of sexual threat and more. There\u2019s also a lot of racist behavior, including White doctors giving poison to Native American characters in the guise of medicine.

      "Hanging in Khlo\u00e9 Lewis\u2019 closet is a shimmering lavender party dress with a single puffed sleeve, a bedazzled mini dress with matching cowboy hat, and a rose-colored shirt. She wore these items to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance World Tour, and the Barbie movie, respectively. For Lewis, a 29-year-old PR professional, dressing up made the experience even better. ",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always fun to have a reason to dress up in something that\u2019s outside of your norm,\u201d she told TIME.",
      "Lewis isn\u2019t alone. This summer, concert and moviegoers showed up in themed regalia. For Barbie, attendees donned all shades of pink, from a shocking magenta to more demure hues of bubblegum. At the Eras Tour, Swifties paid homage with sparkles, bright colors, and friendship bracelets. Meanwhile, fans wore disco-inspired clubwear in silver and black, accessorizing with rhinestone-encrusted cowboy hats and boots, to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Club Renaissance. And with Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 both dropping concert movies, it appears that the costume party that was 2023 shows no sign of stopping.",

      "Fashion historian and \u200b\u200bassistant curator of fashion at the Cleveland Museum of Art, Darnell-Jamal Lisby agrees, saying that the outsize showing of themed dressing this summer could be a reflection of the freedom people craved after the pandemic.",
      "\u201cPost-pandemic, people want to be free to be their authentic selves,\u201d Lisby told TIME. \u201cPeople want to have fun with it and experiment because that\u2019s something in their control and something that they can use to communicate to each other and within themselves about how they're feeling and how they\u2019re connected.\u201d\u00a0",
      "For Dalvin Brown, a 30-year-old journalist who saw Beyonc\u00e9 for the first time on the Renaissance  tour, that connection happened both in person and online. Brown, who sported a diamant\u00e9 bodysuit with a male physique design on it and a studded cowboy hat and leather jacket, went viral online for his striking look, captured and shared by Beyhive fans at the concert. Brown says the influx of interest in dressing up was accelerated by the pandemic, but also by the Internet, where social media rapidly disseminated trends and fast fashion from online retailers has made putting together a look nearly effortless.",

      "\u201cThe access to fast fashion and the Internet creates this world where if you want to experiment with how you dress, you can,\u201d he told TIME. \u201cThere's lots of inspiration online and you\u2019re pretty much getting permission from the Internet because there's so many people expressing themselves in really creative and wild ways.\u201d",
      "The element of connection was an essential part of Anna Belkin\u2019s decision to dress up for the three Barbie screenings she went to in the span of two weeks. The 34-year-old attorney dressed in a pink jumpsuit for a viewing on opening night; for the second screening, she went with her parents and helped her mother find a pink scarf, while her father wore a shirt that read \u201cOn  Wednesdays, we smash the patriarchy\u201d in pink lettering. For the third screening, which was part of a bachelorette party activity, she wore pastels to complement the bride-to-be\u2019s outfit. Belkin says dressing up was a way to share the experience with the people she loved. She was also pleasantly surprised by the camaraderie it sparked with her fellow moviegoers.",
      "\u201cPart of the joy of dressing up was to fully be a part of the experience,\u201d she told TIME. \u201cIt was truly delightful to walk around in public, where everyone is saying to each other, complete strangers, \u2018Hi Barbie!\u2019 It's nice to be a part of a bigger thing, even if it\u2019s a movie about a doll that is literally like sanctioned by the corporation that makes it, and to feel like you're not just enjoying the art, but you're a part of the art.\u201d ",
      "Read more: How Barbie Took Over the World",
      "For Jezz Chung, a 32-year-old author, artist and performer, dressing up for the Renaissance tour and the Barbie movie was an empowering experience, rooted in queer community and fun. Chung, who is autistic, said that their outfit was an important part of their sensory experience of the concert. Before attending, Chung hand-affixed gems to a pair of pants, relishing both the feel and the look of the outfit. Dressing, especially in tumultuous times, can be a daily but not insignificant way to claim space, Chung says. A brightly colored outfit or smattering of sparkling rhinestones is a way to express themselves and to present the way they want to, regardless of social conventions.",
      "\u201cDressing up feels like a way to maintain a sort of agency of our bodies and our lives, shaping who we are in this world and how we get to show up,\u201d they told TIME. \u201cThere\u2019s a deep history with people of color, queer people, any kind of marginalized people looking to beauty and fashion, whether that\u2019s clothes, makeup or artistry, to practice a sense of deep liberation.\u201d",

      "\u2014 Hollywood\u2019s latest attempt to delve into the opioid crisis is the glossy, starry \u201cPain Hustlers,\u201d starring Emily Blunt, Chris Evans and Andy Garcia. Based on a New York Times Magazine article (which then became a book) by Evan Hughes, \u201cPain Hustlers,\u201d on Netflix now, centers on a pharmaceutical startup, Insys Therapeutics, which engaged in criminal activities like bribery and kickbacks and misleading insurers to push their addictive oral fentanyl spray called Subsys. Blunt plays a high school dropout who gets a job at the company, run by Garcia, where she excels. Directed by David Yates, \u201cPain Hustlers\u201d was not generally well received by critics at its Toronto International Film Festival premiere, but Alyssa Wilkinson wrote for Vox that, though predictable, \u201c\u2019Pain Hustlers\u2019 manages to be lively and moving.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Taylor Swift\u2019s reimagined \u201c1989\u201d is here, the album that ushered in the first Peak Swift era \u2014 revisited at the height of her massive pop culture dominance.",
      "Released in 2014 and named for her birth year, the original \u201c1989\u201d signified a sonic rebirth. Swift had shed the Nashville country roots of her first four studio albums and announced herself a full-fledged pop superstar.",
      "\u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d out Friday, takes that version of Swift \u2014 then in her mid-20s, living in New York, prepared to take on the world with an arsenal of \u201980s synth sounds and a new producer named Jack Antonoff \u2014 and includes five unreleased \u201cvault\u201d tracks that deliver more clues about the artist she was then.",
      "Previous \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d releases have been more than conventional rerecordings, arriving with new music, Easter eggs and visuals that deepen understanding of her work. The project \u2014 the fourth of six rereleases \u2014 was instigated by music manager Scooter Braun\u2019s purchase and sale of her early catalog and represents Swift\u2019s effort to control her own songs and how they\u2019re used.",
      "Her return to \u201c1989\u201d \u2014 the album where she began to confront media portrayals of herself and in song \u2014 comes at another Swift popularity crescendo but also during a 2010s nostalgia (Yes, it\u2019s only 2023. Yes, the nostalgia is real).",
      "Here are some key things to consider as \u201c1989\u201d propels the New Peak Swift era forward:",
      "Listeners will dive deep into the vault tracks for clues into Swift\u2019s mind around 2014. \u201cSlut!\u201d may recall her contentious relationship with the press, which fixated on her alleged romantic relationships and the songs she\u2019d write once they ended.",
      "They\u2019ll find connections to \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d on \u201cIs It Over Now?\u201d in the lyrics \u201cwhen you lost control / red blood, white snow.\u201d They\u2019ll wonder who made her pretend to like acid rock and mega yachts on \u201cNow That We Don\u2019t Talk.\u201d But more insight will be found in thinking about where Swift was at the time, what came next, and how that mirrors the current moment.",
      "Swift dominated headlines and award show crowd shots in 2014, reaching a point of oversaturation, and leading to her retreat from the public eye prior to the release of her undercelebrated revenge record, 2017\u2019s \u201cReputation.\u201d With Swift getting similar treatment on NFL broadcasts due to her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, could history repeat itself?",
      "Brittany Spanos, senior writer at Rolling Stone, puts it simply: \u201cPeople just get easily sick of anyone who\u2019s super famous. And I think that we haven\u2019t had a lot of monocultural kind of celeb moments like this in a minute,\u201d she says of Swift in 2023.",
      "Rebecca Jennings, a senior correspondent at Vox covering social platforms and the creator economy, sees a connection between the 2014 eras as being \u201cpost-recession\u201d and 2023 being \u201cpost-COVID,\u201d a time where Swift succeeds because there\u2019s a sort of cultural \u201cbouncing back vibe,\u201d a time where people want celebratory music.",
      "In 2014, that was Swift finding her pop sound with \u201c1989.\u201d",
      "In 2023, it\u2019s becoming the most successful version of herself, and rereleasing \u201c1989 \u201d while on the top of her game.",
      "\u201cIt was a huge risk for her to move completely outside of country \u2013 there\u2019s no country elements on this album whatsoever,\u201d says Spanos, who also teaches a course on Swift at New York University\u2019s Clive Davis Institute. She says Swift\u2019s penchant for pop songwriting is evidenced all the way back on her 2008 sophomore release \u201cFearless\u201d in tracks like \u201cLove Story,\u201d but \u201c1989\u201d is \u201cher first official, full-length pop project.\u201d",
      "However, more so than a declarative move into pop, Spanos views \u201c1989\u201d as \u201cmore in the lineage of the kind of transitional albums teen stars tend to make when they move into adulthood,\u201d comparing it to Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cControl\u201d and Christina Aguilera\u2019s \u201cStripped.\u201d \u201c1989\u201d is the album where Swift\u2019s divorced herself from adolescence. She\u2019s moved to NYC; she\u2019s working with new people; she\u2019s making synth pop.",
      "Rachel Brodsky, a music and culture writer who has been covering Swift for well over a decade, points out that Swift\u2019s sonic experimentations were earned \u2014 and that she very well might be one of the final pop superstars who couldn\u2019t come out of the gate playing with genre the way listeners are accustomed to now.",
      "\u201cShe came up in the shadow of the Chicks, where she was told under certain circumstances by her team, like, \u2019You don\u2019t want to be the Chicks,\u201d Brodsky says of the country music group who were chastised for going against the expectations of their audience.",
      "The Chicks, acts like Shania Twain and LeAnn Rimes cracked open the door for Swift to burst open on \u201c1989,\u201d she says. And not just as a pop musician, but as someone bucking convention \u2014 something Brodsky says artists like Kacey Musgraves, Maren Morris and even Olivia Rodrigo have followed.",
      "By the time \u201c1989\u201d rolled around, Swift was no longer writing high school romances and fairytale narratives.",
      "She\u2019d begun engaging with her celebrity reality \u2014 inviting Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z to her birthday party, hanging out with models and other very famous people in a group labeled \u201cthe Squad\u201d in the media.",
      "She was also writing songs like \u201c\u2019Bad Blood,\u2019 which is about her feud with Katy Perry,\u201d says Spanos, a decisive move away from the kind of humility and \u201chometown girl\u201d image associated with \u201ccountry Taylor.\u201d That meant occupying more space in the pop landscape: reconciling with Kanye West after the infamous 2009 VMAs moment, starring alongside Drake in a commercial, getting Kendrick Lamar on a remix, so on and so forth.",
      "In 2023, Swift is more famous now than she was then, and she's still engaging with her celebrity in a very public way.",
      "Jennings believes people are nostalgic for the year 2014 and always will be \u2014 because it was one of the last online periods before the hyper-commodification of social media \u2014 which makes 2023 the ideal time for revisiting \u201c1989.\u201d",
      "There were blogs, and Tumblr, and our internet lives were less defined by algorithms. \u201cIt is looked at as this Edenic time of innocence and purity,\u201d she says. At the time, there was a kind of monoculture that leans itself to nostalgia in 2023, she says \u2014 everyone receiving the same information on the same topics at the same time, Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d era included \u2014 as opposed to the current influencer-based model.",
      "(It\u2019s worth noting that Swift herself was very active on Tumblr, using the social media platform to find fans to invite to private listening sessions held in her home.)",
      "Additionally, in the last few months, Swift has been seen dining with very famous friends like Blake Lively, Sophie Turner and Selena Gomez, a return to the language of her \u201cSquad.\u201d \u201cBy parading out many of the same friends she had during that era that she was also parading about, she\u2019s playing into this nostalgia element,\u201d argues Jennings.",
      "At the time, theories swirled around Swift\u2019s assumed romantic relationships \u2014 many believe the song \u201cStyle\u201d is about her short relationship with Harry Styles \u2014 and in 2023, her latest assumed romance has become a top story again.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like she\u2019s method promoting,\u201d Spanos jokes. \u201cShe\u2019s leaning into it again.\u201d But there\u2019s a huge difference in the kind of treatment she\u2019s receiving from the public this time around. The press appears to be rooting for her relationship, she says, instead of thinking about the breakup songs it might inspire, warning her male partners and turning Swift into the butt of the joke \u2014 as the media was doing in 2014.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit less of that level of misogyny,\u201d Spanos says.",
      "So what\u2019s next for Swift?",
      "The continuation of her Eras tour, which is set to resume on November 9th in Buenos Aires, Argentina. And, of course, two more \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d albums.",

      "Taylor Swift\u2019s breakthrough album is breaking through again.",
      "The re-release of \u201c1989\u201d has outsold the original\u2019s first week numbers by a fairly wide margin. \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d sold 1.65 million copies in its first week, a 28% improvement on the 1.29 million the original sold. That makes it the fifth best selling album, as ranked by Week One sales.",
      "The remake also set a new personal Week One sales record for Swift.",
      "The entertainer has been remaking her back catalog for years, offering covers of her own songs after she was unable to buy the master recording copyrights. But \u201c1989\u201d is a different beast than \u201cRed\u201d or \u201cFearless\u201d. This was the album that firmly moved her from country/crossover artist to fully fledged pop star. Its hits include \u201cShake It Off,\u201d \u201cBlank Space\u201d and \u201cStyle\u201d.",
      "Swift knows the value of the album, too. While it would have been an easy one to reissue first, she opted to hold it in reserve until consumers were used to the idea of re-releases. And long before the fight for her master recordings was a consideration, she stopped allowing streaming services from playing the album as she lobbied for higher streaming fees (and earned more from physical and digital release sales).",
      "Beyond the original album\u2019s hits, the re-release comes with additional tracks, which didn\u2019t make the original album\u2019s final cut. \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d includes five previously unreleased songs.",
      "The business strategy has worked. Swift is hands down the music industry\u2019s biggest star today. Her Eras tour was so popular it has been mentioned in reports by the Federal Reserve and put Ticketmaster in the crosshairs of Congress after it melted down when tickets went on sale. Recently, Swift officially became a billionaire following the U.S. leg of the tour.",

      "With the release of \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d her fourth re-recorded album, Taylor Swift has never been bigger. What started as a seeming passion project to reclaim her life\u2019s work has catapulted the 33-year-old pop artist to be the biggest living musician in the world no matter how you slice it: sales, streams, concert ticket sales, and even the box office.",
      "The newest version of \u201c1989 TV,\u201d released at the end of October,\u00a0sold 1.65 million copies in its first week, according to Luminate Data, making it Swift\u2019s third album to surpass 1 million sales in the past year and the fifth best-selling week for an album since Luminate began tracking sales in 1991. More surprising: In an era when no one buys music, it outsold the first week of even the original \u201c1989,\u201d considered the first apex of Swift\u2019s career. It also dwarfs the success of her other Taylor\u2019s Versions re-records\u2014\u201dFearless,\u201d \u201cRed,\u201d and \u201cSpeak Now\u201d\u2014which rocked the industry on their own.",
      "\u201cI imagine it has been beyond what she or anyone could have expected,\u201d says Kelcie Schofield, a 2023 graduate from the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business who wrote a case study on the sale of Swift\u2019s masters that kickstarted the entire Taylor\u2019s Version re-recording process. \u201cIt has been a career-defining endeavor.\u201d ",
      "Swift has been releasing new versions of her first six albums after losing the rights to her master recordings. She says her musical catalogue was sold twice, despite actively trying to buy it herself (some of the parties involved dispute that characterization); the pop star has framed the project as a way to retake ownership of her art and musical legacy.",
      "What began as Swift\u2019s \u201cworst case scenario\u201d has turned into a more artistically and commercially fruitful endeavor than anyone could have imagined when she announced her intentions back in 2020. Between the re-recordings, her record-shattering Eras Tour, and her consistent ability to put out new music, Swift has created her own musical ecosystem, with each component helping to propel the success of the others. The synergy is working so well, she recently joined the ranks of billionaires, according to Bloomberg. ",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could have predicted they\u2019d be as popular as they have been,\u201d Schofield says of the re-recordings. \u201cYou\u2019d expect them to be huge, but they\u2019ve been absolutely massive.\u201d",
      "All of that is bad news for Shamrock Capital Advisors, the investment firm that bought the masters to Swift\u2019s first six albums from music executive Scooter Braun\u2019s Ithaca Holdings back in 2020. Shamrock will benefit from the uptick in streams of the original versions of her songs that predictably accompany each re-release. But thanks to her songwriting credits on every song in her catalogue, Swift has been able to block other media\u2014including movies and TV shows\u2014from incorporating them into their productions. Radio stations and streaming platforms have also sworn their fealty to the artist, pledging to put the Taylor\u2019s Versions onto playlists and on air, further devaluing the original recordings. ",
      "Other artists have re-recorded their music for similar reasons to Swift, to far less impact, at least in terms of sales and cultural acclaim. Thank Swift\u2019s fans. Over her 15-plus-year career, Swift has formed a fiercely loyal community that is only growing thanks to the symbiotic relationship between the Eras Tour and the re-recordings (not to mention the Easter eggs and deep well of lore surrounding Swift and her music). ",
      "As new fans attend the tour (or watch a livestream on TikTok), they discover Swift\u2019s older albums; when those albums are re-released, a new generation of fans get to experience the era for the first time, in real time. ",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like she\u2019s the first person to ever do this. But she\u2019s the first person to make it a phenomenon,\u201d says Schofield. \u201cThe Swifties are a powerful bunch.\u201d",
      "The effort has been so successful, in fact, that record labels are reportedly reworking contracts so that in the future, artists they sign cannot re-record their music for longer periods of time or at all.",
      "Also playing into Swift\u2019s success? Fans falling back in love with vinyl (and the pop star offering plenty of vinyl options to purchase). \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d sold 693,000 vinyl copies in its first week, a record for the modern era. The re-release is Swift\u2019s largest traditional sales week of all time.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "In September, when Taylor Swift announced that one of the vault tracks off of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) would be called \u201cSlut!,\u201d it immediately became the most anticipated song from the re-release. ",
      "Released Friday along with the rest of the re-recorded 1989, \"Slut!\" sees Swift boldly reclaiming a word that was often hurled at her, especially in her early years as a singer. Swift is known for her searing, honest lyrics\u2014especially in songs like \u201cAll Too Well\u201d to \u201cDear John\"\u2014which many fans have connected to specific relationships in her life. But critics have used that to turn her into the punchline of sexist jokes, even as recently as 2021 when the Netflix show Ginny and Georgia made a joke at Swift\u2019s expense. (In response, Swift called the joke \"deeply sexist\"). ",
      "In \"Slut!\", Swift embraces the word. \u201cBut if I\u2019m all dressed up they might as well be lookin' at us. And if they call me a slut, you know it might be worth it for once.\u201d She goes on to sing about the public\u2019s perception of her as a \u201crose with thorns.\u201d \u201cLove thorns all over this rose. I\u2019ll pay the price, you won\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cSlut!\u201d isn\u2019t the first time Swift has addressed the media\u2019s coverage of her relationships; two of her most popular songs from 1989 did just that. On \u201cShake It Off,\u201d she sings, \u201cI go on too many dates, but I can\u2019t make them stay; at least that\u2019s what people say.\u201d And on \u201cBlank Space,\u201d \u201cGot a long list of ex-lovers, they\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m insane.\u201d",
      "Swift rarely speaks publicly about her relationships. Still, fans who purchased a physical copy of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) could glean some more insight into her songwriting process while making the album from a letter she included. Swift writes about wanting to silence \u201cthe voices that had begun to shame me in new ways for dating like a normal young woman.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the years preceding this, I had become the target of slut shaming \u2014 the intensity and relentlessness of which would be criticized and called out if it happened today,\" she writes. Swift calls out the jokes about the number of boyfriends she had and the way her songwriting was portrayed as \u201ca predatory act of a boy crazy psychopath.\u201d She writes that this was taking a toll on her, so she needed to write to get through it. \u201cSo I swore off hanging out with guys, dating, flirting, or anything that could be weaponized against me by a culture that claimed to believe in liberating women but consistently treated me with the harsh moral codes of the Victorian era.\" ",
      "The pop star attempted to redirect the attention to her female friendships and how she felt that would\u2019ve been a foolproof way to change the narrative, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case. \u201cIf I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn\u2019t sensationalize or sexualize that \u2014 right? I would learn later on that people could and people would.\u201d",
      "The song itself is an indication of what was going through Swift\u2019s mind during this time in her life and how she had to assuage the negative feelings that arose when, no matter what she did, the public theorized that she was a boy-crazy psychopath who couldn\u2019t keep a man. In fact, she was just a woman who could convey her feelings through song expertly, and sometimes, they happened to be about a specific man. If that makes her a \u201cSlut!\u201d then she's OK with it. ",

      "When Taylor Swift announced in 2019 that she would be re-recording her first six albums in an effort to reclaim her original music, fans began eagerly anticipating the opportunity to revisit the past\u2014and hear beloved songs in a new light. But Swift provided even more than that: In addition to re-releasing the tracks off the albums, she also included songs that almost made the cut. The songs, referred to as \u201cFrom the Vault,\u201d feature collaborations with artists Swift has long admired, like Keith Urban, Chris Stapleton, and Phoebe Bridgers. ",
      "So far, Swift has re-released four albums: Fearless, Red, Speak Now, and 1989. There are 26 \u201cFrom the Vault\u201d songs between them, including the 10-minute version of her heartbreak anthem \u201cAll Too Well.\u201d These are songs about love and longing, regret and revenge, and the thrill of meeting someone who might just change your life. They all offer a new window into who Swift was at the time she was working on them. But some standout more than others. ",
      "To determine which \u201cFrom the Vault\u201d song is the very best, TIME decided to rank them all, with the exception of the 10-minute version of \u201cAll Too Well\u201d\u2014its scope is just too large. To create this ranking, we each compiled our own individual rankings, and then averaged those results.\u00a0",
      "Of Swift\u2019s three collaborations with Ed Sheeran, \u201cRun,\u201d from the Red vault, is the weakest (controversially, I\u2019d rank \u201cEnd Game,\u201d which also features Future, as the best of the bunch). The bare melody and lyrics like \u201cRun like you'd run from the law\u201d make the song  just a bit too basic given the caliber of Swift\u2019s songwriting skills.\u2014Sam Cooney ",
      "Off the Fearless vault, \u201cDon\u2019t You\u201d attempts to capture the messiness of being flooded with conflicting feelings when you unexpectedly run into an ex. While those are all hallmarks of a great Taylor Swift song, \u201cDon\u2019t You\u201d is missing the cutting specificities of the anger, longing, and pretending that come up in those moments that she\u2019s so well-known for. \u201cSo I walk outta here tonight, try to go on with my life. And you can say we\u2019re still friends\u201d comes pretty close, but is just a few drafts away from being totally devastating.\u2014Annabel Gutterman ",
      "True Swifties know this track was leaked in 2017, but now they can rejoice in the official version, off the Fearless vault, featuring country-pop starlet Maren Morris. The solemn ballad meditates on the lingering effects of a messy past relationship\u2014and appears to include several references to many of Swift\u2019s old tracks, including, most prominently, \u201cClean.\u201d \u201cBut no amount of freedom gets you clean. I\u2019ve still got you all over me,\u201d she sings in the chorus, a nod to the 2014 song, in which she sings,  \u201cYou\u2019re still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can\u2019t wear anymore.\u201d\u2014Moises Mendez II ",
      "The plucky, stripped down \u201cWe Were Happy\u201d looks at the ruins of a seemingly troubled relationship with rose-colored glasses: \u201cWhen it was good, baby, it was good, baby, we showed \u2018em all up/ No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark, talkin\u2019 bout your daddy\u2019s farm.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether the relationship is failing or has failed, but the song\u2019s melancholy tone makes either possibility equally sad. Was this one too much of a downer to make the cut for Fearless? Potentially.\u2014A.G. ",
      "\u201cTimeless\u201d is borderline saccharine, a ballad about finding a love so pure that it could exist in any moment in history. Swift tells a story about walking into an antique shop where she saw old photos of a 1930s bride, singing about the \u201ckinda love that you only find once in a lifetime\u201d and how those photos reminded her of the love she feels for her partner. \u201cI know that you and I would've found each other in another life, you still would've turned my head even if w\u0435'd met,\u201d she sings. The track nearly veers into cheesy territory but manages to stay the course, by keeping the historical references at a minimum.\u2014M.M. ",
      "There are unfounded rumors propagated by the Swifities that the title track, \u201cSpeak Now\u201d was inspired by Paramore\u2019s front-woman Hayley Williams, who is said to have attended the wedding of her ex-bandmate and ex-boyfriend, Josh Farro in 2010. Taylor Swift and Williams have both spoken about their friendship at length over the years and Paramore is serving as an opening act for more shows of the Eras Tour in 2024, so it was high time the pair find a reason to blend their voices together on a song. The lyrics of the song can be interpreted to be about the failing of relationships, burning those bridges and the metaphorical castle of a partnership being destroyed. Or, it could be about the undoing of a seemingly-perfect reputation\u2014which Swift dealt with after her falling out with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and Williams after Paramore\u2019s bassist Jeremy Davis sued the band and left.\u2014M.M. ",
      "Swift writes a song about supporting a friend through a difficult time. Like most of the best songs on Red, you can hear the emotions in Swift\u2019s voice. The trumpets at the beginning of the song add nice texture, too.\u2014S.C. ",
      "\u201cGot a feelin\u2019 your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life\u201d\u2014that\u2019s a line that belongs on the soundtracks of nearly every early 2010s YA novel turned film adaptation. This is Taylor Swift bringing the drama and describing, in earnest, what it\u2019s like to really need someone, and need them right now. Sure, the idea of an \u201celectric touch\u201d is kind of silly, but this song is a bop!\u2014A.G. ",
      "Who among us hasn\u2019t pined after a person who has left us on read and waited desperately for them to text back, only to find out they are with someone else? Just me? The way Swift describes this feeling in the bridge of the song\u2014\u201cI will get your longing glances but she\u2019ll get your ring. You will say you had the best of intentions, and maybe I will finally learn my lesson\u201d\u2014shows she might get it, too. Love (or what we perceive to be love) will make us foolish, but no matter what, there\u2019s always a lesson at the end of the road\u2014some of them are easier to learn than others.\u2014M.M. ",
      "A pop track about missing the beginning of a relationship after it\u2019s over, this song is mostly fine. You can see why Swift cut it from Red\u2014the lyrics are somewhat derivative of her other, greater works. Lyrics like \"But don't forget about the night out in L.A. Danced in the kitchen, chased me down through the hallway\u201d just don\u2019t make the same impact after you\u2019ve heard \"All Too Well\"\u2019s \u201c'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night. We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light.\u201d\u2014S.C. ",
      "The second vault track from 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) depicts yet another bruising heartbreak, this time focusing on the pain of watching someone you love walk away, and still wanting them even when they didn\u2019t choose you. And while the lyrics are devastating, the emotional core of the song comes from a fleeting moment of anger in the bridge when Swift screams: \u201cI said I love you. You say nothin\u2019 back.\u201d More of that rage, please!\u2014A.G.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "This song arrives in the middle of our ranking because it is just that: mid-tier. \u201cBye Bye Baby\u201d is a slow track about moving on after a heartbreak. There\u2019s nothing particularly wrong with it, but there aren\u2019t any standout lyrics, either.\u2014A.G.  ",
      "The upbeat, punchy song invites you to dance around and shout lyrics about having a crush on someone who you can\u2019t stop thinking about. In some ways, it\u2019s the precursor to Red\u2019s \u201cTreacherous,\u201d which acknowledges that the flip side of falling in love is risking being hurt (\u201cNothing safe is worth the drive\u201d). \u201cMessage in a Bottle\u201d is not concerned with the realities of such heartbreak. And that\u2019s what makes it so fun!\u2014A.G. ",
      "\u201cNow That We Don\u2019t Talk\u201d kind of sounds like a b-side of \u201cAll You Had To Do Was Stay.\u201d (For you Swiftie sleuths, consider that the motif of \u201cpaying the price\u201d is present in the lyrics or the former and the liner note of the latter.) Perhaps the most 1989-sounding of all the vault tracks, this airy tune is all about the push-and-pull of a new break up. Maybe you want them back\u2014but also, maybe you don\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t have to pretend I like acid rock, or that I\u2019d like to be on a mega yacht,\u201d Swift croons over a synth-laden beat. Relatable!\u2014R.S.\u00a0",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s When\u201d contemplates whether it\u2019s worth picking up the pieces of a damaged relationship, and trying again. In wistful and remorseful turns, Swift acutely describes feeling caught between your heart and your head. The song also features Keith Urban, her second collaboration with the country artist after appearing on Tim McGraw's single \u201cHighway Don\u2019t Care.\u201d\u2014A.G. ",
      "This empowering song sees Swift reclaiming a word that has been hurled at her for years. In a letter accompanying the physical copies of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), Swift writes that she had become a \u201ctarget for slut shaming\u201d and it started to take a toll on her. To get through it, she turned to writing\u2014and this shimmering feminist anthem was born.\u2013M.M.",
      "After cutting it from 2012\u2019s Red, Swift sold this track\u2014about breaking up with a cheating partner\u2014to country duo Sugarland. But Babe has all of the hallmarks of one of Swift\u2019s greatest breakup songs: it balances her pitch-perfect pettiness (You really blew this, babe) with her pain (I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe). While Sugarland\u2019s version leans into the anguish, Swift turns her version into a pure pop diss track. It\u2019s his fault, okay?\u2014S.C. ",
      "Though \u201cSuburban Legends\u201d may sound more like its off Midnights than 1989 (cue the \u201cMastermind\u201d similarities), there\u2019s no question that it\u2019s still a total bop. Swift is at her best when she\u2019s nostalgic and here she details a relationship between two lovers navigating a small town and a big romance, imagining what it would be like to show up at their high school reunion together. She\u2019s sentimental, but ruthless: \u201cWhen you hold me, it holds me together. And you kiss me in a way that\u2019s gonna screw me up forever.\u201d\u2014A.G.\u00a0",
      "I love when Taylor Swift writes songs about other girls, particularly her friends. Ever the great observer, here, Swift sings about a girl named Emma as she grows head over heels for someone. \u201cWhen Emma falls in love, it's all on her face, hangs in the air like stars in outer space,\u201d Swift croons over a wistful melody both in amazement and yearning. One can only hope to have as much main character energy as Emma. Plus, it\u2019s oddly reminiscent of my favorite karaoke song \u201cDrops of Jupiter.\u201d What more could anyone ask for?\u2014Rachel Sonis ",
      "\"Better Man\" isn\u2019t just one of the best vault tracks\u2014it\u2019s one of Taylor Swift\u2019s best songs. Swift perfectly captures the nuance, confusion, and heartache of loving someone even when you know they\u2019re bad for you. The bridge (\u201cI hold onto this pride because, these days, it's all I have. And I gave to you my best. And we both know you can't say that\u201d) stings. Swift doesn\u2019t deviate much from Little Big Town\u2019s 2016 version, but her grown-up vocals help her stick the landing. The only downside is that this was left off Red in the first place.\u2014S.C. ",
      "Swift\u2019s rumored relationship with Harry Styles resulted in one of the most expertly-produced pop songs ever, \u201cStyle.\u201d With \u201cIs It Over Now?\u201d Swift retreads old territory, reflecting on a former love through memories they shared. In a 2014 Rolling Stone cover story, Swift said that she was in a snowmobile accident with an ex (who many assumed to be Styles since the accident was referenced in \u201cStyle\u201d). The is referenced in this vault track when she sings, \u201cWhen you lost control. Red blood, white snow,\u201d then adding a dig at her ex, saying he searches \u201cin every model\u2019s bed for something greater\u201d and that every new girl he dates is \u201cher clone.\u201d It\u2019s a blistering takedown that sees Swift trying to lift herself up and move on.\u2013M.M.",
      "No one captures the pain ofa woman scorned better than Taylor Swift. But this song is the perfect example of missing that person you once had and knowing that you deserve better because your differences are too big. Add in Chris Stapleton\u2019s gruff, billowing vocals and you have a masterpiece dedicated to moving on. Swift knows how to pick a collaborator whose emotionality doesn\u2019t overpower hers and the duo create a song that\u2019s not about revenge, but is rather a stinging ditty dedicated to not compromising oneself for a partner.\u2013M.M. ",
      "Forbidden love is electrifying and scary at the same time and Swift was able to capture those feelings perfectly in this vault track. The plucky guitars along with the production helped form a mysterious sonic landscape, complemented by a music video that starred Joey King, Taylor Lautner, Presley Cash, and Swift in a heist scenario. It\u2019s a fun pop song that would have done well if it had made its way onto the original tracklist, but we\u2019re still grateful to have gotten it over a decade later.\u2013M.M. ",
      "No one can write a break-up song like Taylor Swift, and \u201cMr. Perfectly Fine,\u201d which should have been on Fearless, proves it. This is Swift at her best, enraged, snarky, and not for a moment taking herself too seriously: \u201cAnd I never got past what you put me through, but it\u2019s wonderful to see that it never phased you!\u201d Rumored to be about her ex Joe Jonas, the track encapsulates the album it was almost on\u2014it\u2019s a fearless takedown of a man who did his woman very wrong. Plus, there\u2019s the mention of \u201ccasually cruel,\u201d which Swift pockets to use later on \u201cAll Too Well.\u201d\u2014A.G. ",
      "\u201cLord, what will become of me once I've lost my novelty?\u201d With mellow acoustic guitars, sparse piano, and a haunting assist from indie rock darling Phoebe Bridgers, Swift perfectly captures an eternal thought that many people (particularly women) have on constant replay: How does getting older affect us? How much possibility\u2014and the sweet taste of being young, infinite, and alive\u2014do we have left once we\u2019ve made our choices? How do we continue to reinvent ourselves within a culture marred by its obsession with youth? Especially for two women that are consistently in the spotlight, it\u2019s no easy thing; for youth is fickle\u2014but so is celebrity, fame, and Hollywood.",
      "It's interesting, if a little sad, that Swift was plagued with this thought at only 22 when she wrote this song, knowing where she is now. Having reinvented herself a million times over, Swift has dealt with plenty of setbacks, but even more triumphs. I wonder what she thinks of this song these days, and if the quest for being an ing\u00e9nue has been replaced with something even more promising: wisdom.\u2014R.S.\u00a0",

      "It came to her in a dream (an embarrassing one, at that), Taylor Swift recalled about the origin of her song, \u201cAll You Had To Do Was Stay.\u201d On the cusp of her ascent into stratospheric superstardom with the release of her fifth studio album 1989 in 2014, Swift explained to TIME that in the dream, her ex had come to her front door to get her back, and all she could say back was a high-pitched \u201cStay.\u201d ",
      "\u201cIt was almost operatic,\u201d Swift said. \u201cI woke up from the dream, saying the weird part into my phone, figuring I had to include it in something because it was just too strange not to. In pop, it\u2019s fun to play around with little weird noises like that.\u201d ",
      "It\u2019s how some of our greatest pop songs have come about: making music out of the weird or the strange. That's why it is all the more surprising that \u201cAll You Had To Do Was Stay\u201d has never gotten its due. With the release of Swift\u2019s rerecording of 1989 bringing Taylor\u2019s version of the song, nine years after the original, the time has come to reassess the long underappreciated track. ",
      "There\u2019s a science, of course, behind \u201cAll You Had To Do Was Stay\u201d and its placement on 1989. The song falls into what Swifties call the \u201cTrack Five\u201d factor. If you look at Swift\u2019s albums, the story goes, the fifth track of each one is the saddest and most cathartic of the project\u2014and typically best captures its mood and message. On Fearless, it was \u201cWhite Horse.\u201d On Speak Now, it was \u201cDear John\u201d and on Red, \u201cAll Too Well.\u201d The list goes on, and for the release of her seventh studio album Lover (with \u201cThe Archer\u201d as track five), Swift acknowledged the clear pattern.  ",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was doing this, but as I was making albums, I guess I was just kind of putting a very vulnerable, personal, honest, emotional song as track five,\u201d Swift revealed. \u201cSo because you noticed this, I kind of started to put the songs that were really honest, emotional, vulnerable, and personal as track five.\u201d",
      "Read More: The Staggering Economic Impact of Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour",
      "Contrary to popular opinion, this is also true of \u201cAll You Had To Do Was Stay.\u201d It\u2019s one of the saddest songs in Swift\u2019s discography, but it\u2019s created in a way that feels foreign to those who have been following her music since she cried tears on her guitar. In fact, it\u2019s worth asking if it\u2019s a strategic move for the self-proclaimed \u201cmastermind\u201d of subtext. ",
      "Saying so long to the country darling we once knew, 1989 marked Swift\u2019s entry squarely into the pop arena. We heard inklings of this in Red two years prior, but this time, the shift in sound was unmistakable: Swift was charting a path toward a kind of pop stardom where her music was going to become ubiquitous and permeable\u2014heard in your bedroom, your mom\u2019s car, or even on the dance floor. ",
      "In many ways, this album was meant to be a light-hearted pop forward soundtrack to Swift\u2019s life. \u201cShake It Off\u201d and \u201cBlank Space\u201d were devil-may-care responses to the media circus and Swift\u2019s romantic throes while \u201cWelcome to New York\u201d was a gleeful proclamation of young adulthood and finding one\u2019s footing in a world that is electric and full of possibility. Even the most pointed of songs, \u201cBad Blood,\u201d still feels coy and playful. But as any Swiftie knows, you can never have fun without the pain. And that\u2019s where \u201cAll You Had To Do Was Stay\u201d plays its critical role. ",
      "Read More: The 17 Most Anticipated Albums of Fall 2023",
      "Perhaps that\u2019s part of the brilliance of 1989, but also of Swift\u2019s mastery. Behind the pulsing synths, drum pads, and processed backing vocals, lyrically, the story she\u2019s trying to tell is just as vulnerable, relatable, and cutting. \u201cPeople like you always want back the love they pushed aside. But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye\u201d\u2014a line that lands with a sinister calm before an explosive \u201cstay!\u201d carries us into the chorus. There, with brutal honesty, Swift battles how complicated breakups can be: how you might hate someone and still want them back. How people inflict their deepest wounds on each other despite their best intentions. And how you can dance through the sadness and feel release\u2014from that person and sometimes, even, from yourself. ",
      "Catharsis comes in many forms and from places where you\u2019d least expect. Sometimes it\u2019s tender and quiet. But it can also be loud and raise hell. With \u201cAll You Had To Do Was Stay,\u201d Swift made clear that catharsis in the form of the latter was OK\u2014that loudness and spectacle is OK. The song\u2019s drama, sharp storytelling, and dreamlike quality are unmistakably Swiftian. At the same time, it shows the beauty of how pop music works: How weird and crazy sounds and your most embarrassing stories and dreams can be operatic and accessible. If only you give yourself enough room to lean into it and dance. ",

      "The winter of 2014 was painfully cold in New York City. The sidewalks were frozen with slicks of ice, an inhospitable grid of accidents waiting to happen. But stamped across bus stop shelters and plastered across subway billboards, one simple catchphrase kept cropping up: Welcome to New York. The person behind this message was Taylor Swift, the city\u2019s newly-christened \u201cglobal welcome ambassador.\u201d \u201cWelcome to New York\u201d also happened to be the title of the opening song on Swift\u2019s fifth studio album, 1989, which was released to instant fanfare and chart success on Oct. 27 of that year.",
      "It was a perfect marketing campaign: New York, capital of all things cool, meet Swift, America\u2019s country-pop queen. By association, Swift made it clear she was entering a new phase of her career. Swift had recently relocated from Nashville to the bright lights and slushy streets of Manhattan, where she settled into a hip downtown neighborhood and was regularly photographed. A decade into her career, she seemed eager for the reinvention that the city that never sleeps could offer. It was a momentous life change, the kind that generations of young women had pursued in a search for a new, glamorous, and emancipated American dream of independence. But for Swift, 1989 represented more than just a change of personal pace. The album changed her career\u2014and the music industry\u2014forever.",
      "Read More: The Staggering Economic Impact of Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour",
      "1989 cemented Swift\u2019s place as not only an artist with longevity, but a star who would make music on her own terms. Nine years later, she is re-releasing this game-changing work once again, as part of her project of recording \u201cTaylor\u2019s Versions\u201d of her discography. The reason? Ownership. After her first six albums were sold against her will four years ago, Swift decided to reclaim her masters by re-recording her albums. This trip down memory lane has proved fruitful, allowing her to revisit her hits, retool certain lyrics, share additional unreleased songs, and draw attention to the breadth of her oeuvre, and not just the most recent output. She\u2019s continued to re-release albums during her record-breaking 2023 Eras stadium tour and the release of the blockbuster Eras movie in mid-October. This late-autumn delivery of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) isn\u2019t so much a rehashing of the past as a return to the memory of why\u2014and how\u2014Swift established herself in the pop firmament nearly a decade ago. Even Swift recognizes it as a turning point, both artistically and personally: \u201cI look at this album,\u201d she said at the time to Billboard, \u201cas me starting over.\u201d",
      "Swift announced the album in an April 2014 livestream at the top of New York's Empire State Building. She performed the album\u2019s first single, \u201cShake It Off,\u201d a pure pop confection, to a crowd of lucky superfans. The lead-up\u2014a full-court promotional press tour that included buzzy magazine covers and private listening sessions for carefully selected fans\u2014showcased Swift\u2019s marketing savvy as well as her penchant for personal touches. This wasn\u2019t just another album; it was a moment, a follow-up to the highly-lauded Red that promised to surpass even that album\u2019s mainstream ambitions.",
      "1989 wasn\u2019t just the musical evolution of a country artist, though. It was a contemporary pop manifesto, a clapback against criticisms of both her personal life and artistic skill. It was also a powerful statement of identity, presented with a glittering, knowing wink. Swift turned to pop\u2019s most well-known producers to help craft this crucial next phase: Swedish sensations Max Martin and Shellback, hitmakers Greg Kurstin and Ryan Tedder, and Jack Antonoff of indie rock band fun., who would become Swift\u2019s most prolific creative partner. \u201cIn the past, I\u2019ve always tried to make sure that I was maintaining a stronghold on two different genres, and this time I just had to think about one, which was creatively a relief,\u201d she told Billboard in 2014. \u201cIt was nice to be honest about what I was making.\u201d\u00a0",
      "The result was 16 tracks that spanned heartfelt love songs (\u201cThis Love\u201d), empowerment anthems (\u201cShake It Off,\u201d \u201cBlank Space\u201d), and lush, operatic earworms (\u201cWildest Dreams,\u201d \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d). The music also suggested the staccato intensity she would later harness on 2017\u2019s Reputation album (\u201cI Know Places\u201d) and the softness she would experiment with on Folklore (\u201cClean\u201d). Young female artists historically struggle with being pigeonholed by genre or sound: on 1989, Swift made it clear that she was interested in expressing herself over a full, uninhibited range of musical moods and production styles.",
      "The music videos were a similar pastiche of romantic narratives turned upside down and knowing nods to a generation\u2019s obsession with celebrity. Swift wasn\u2019t afraid to poke fun at herself, opening the door for a new kind of star, one who was in on the joke. It was silly; it was meta; it was, in a decade of FaceTuned perfection and sexualized empowerment, refreshing.\u00a0",
      "But it wasn\u2019t just her music that was notable at the time of 1989\u2019s release. It was also her vocal stance when it came to making money, and the threat of streaming services on the future of her career. The previous summer, Swift wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, decrying the devaluation of music through streaming\u2019s limited payouts. Just before 1989 dropped, she removed her entire discography from Spotify, signaling her continued discontent. The result was an economic windfall\u2014listeners had to buy 1989 the old-fashioned way, instead of via streaming\u2019s fractional returns. But some critics raised their eyebrows. Did Swift really need to gatekeep her music? She held strong, only returning to Spotify in 2017. (Artists\u2019 challenges with earning off of streaming remain today.)\u00a0",
      "\u201cI think there should be an inherent value placed on art,\u201d she told TIME during an interview for a 2014 cover story. \u201cEverybody\u2019s complaining about how music sales are shrinking, but nobody\u2019s changing the way they\u2019re doing things.\u201d Swift was one of the only artists with both the commercial appeal and critical attention to pull off this radical move; more often, artists who elected to keep their discographies off of streaming simply disappeared from the conversation. But Swift positioned herself as a leader, a self-appointed protector of her fellow musicians. As with the more recent rerecordings, her efforts seem to be aimed at redirecting the music industry away from taking advantage of creativity, and toward awarding creators financially.",
      "None of this would be relevant if Swift\u2019s album wasn\u2019t successful. But it was, by every metric. With 10 Grammy nominations, 1989 won Album of the Year and two other statues. The album also hit number one on Billboard, stayed in the top 10 for a whole year, and sold 1.3 million copies in its first week alone, a high for Swift to this day and a record over the preceding decade. (Billboard also tracks it as, cumulatively, the highest-selling Swift album to date.)",
      "No longer tied to the adolescent narratives of her earlier career, Swift also had a new task at hand: world-building. She had already proved herself adept at developing Swiftian IP, one defined by suburban Americana and the romance of adolescent angst. With 1989, she began to spin a wider and more complex web, one where colors and symbols called back to lyrics from previous works, even as she announced her evolved identity as an artist caught in the full glare of modern celebrity (see: \u201cI Know Places\u201d).\u00a0",
      "Like a Marvel superhero in over-the-knee boots and glossy red lipstick, she collected a gang of powerful women and friends. They appeared in her \u201cBad Blood\u201d music video, and then became mainstays in her social media posts\u2014a real-life girl gang of successful women known across music, film, and fashion. Swift\u2019s romantic relationship history had been regular tabloid fodder; now, her platonic social life became the talk of the town. Swift exemplified the era\u2019s persistent definition of feminism, and often spoke up about being a female leader in an industry dominated by men. \u201cOther women who are killing it should motivate you, thrill you, challenge you and inspire you rather than threaten you and make you feel like you\u2019re immediately being compared to them,\u201d she told TIME.",
      "1989 set Swift up for success\u2014but also painted a target on her back. There was a backlash, a breakup, and, finally, there was 2017\u2019s Reputation, an album so sour, snarky, and self-confident that it proved divisive. (The album, which continues to be beloved by fans, is on the list of Swift\u2019s remaining rerecordings.) But for some of us, walking in her high-heeled footsteps in the New York over which she presided, 1989 was the cusp of something exciting: a young woman rejecting the path she had been prescribed and freeing herself to make bolder, funnier, and more pungent art, even if that included some mistakes. \u201cThis time I\u2019m kind of just doing whatever I feel like,\u201d she said.\u00a0",
      "It was a prescient statement. And this ethos has driven her album rereleases: her storytelling, on her terms, in the light of the lessons she\u2019s learned. Each rerelease stays true to the colorful spirit of the past, but comes shaded with the wisdom of hindsight. Isn\u2019t that how we should all approach our memories, and the stories of our lives? The new 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) could never surprise me in the way that first, exciting thrum of \u201cWelcome to New York\u201d did. Yet it\u2019s a reminder that in the quest for living your truth, reinvention is not only possible, but necessary. \u201cThe lights are so bright,\u201d she sang on that seminal song. \u201cBut they never blind me.\u201d The path to self-actualization, it turns out, needed her illumination.",

      "An eastern Ontario city's plan to house homeless people this winter is being met with a mix\u00a0of relief and\u00a0regret, coming less than a week after a woman died\u00a0in a local encampment.\u00a0",
      "On Thursday, the City of Cornwall announced it will use\u00a0a former nursing home as a transitional housing and support services hub. The goal is\u00a0to then move people to more permanent sites, including a former school being retrofitted to provide supportive housing units and tiny homes.",
      "Cornwall's homelessness problem has become more visible since the COVID-19 pandemic, with encampments taking root at multiple sites, most recently at a riverside park where a 67-year-old woman, Diane Hebert, was found dead in a tent on Sunday morning.\u00a0",
      "The city says it has been working behind the scenes on homelessness solutions for months. Hebert's death, and its timing, has hit hard.",
      "Coun. Sarah Good called the news \"gutting\" and the timing \"brutal,\" while fellow councillor Claude McIntosh said the death\u00a0was a \"game-changer.\"\u00a0",
      "Mayor Justin Towndale issued a public statement\u00a0in which he took personal responsibility as mayor for what happened, while also stating that Hebert had declined the help of the city's human services department.\u00a0",
      "\"We failed her. I failed her,\" Towndale's statement read.",
      "\"Nothing I can say or do will bring Ms. Hebert back. All I can do is pledge to do better and hope that we can avoid a similar tragedy in the future.\"",
      "Cornwall has no overnight shelter for homeless people\u00a0\u2014 a shock to people coming in from other cities and a factor that led to the camps,\u00a0Taylor Seguin says.",
      "Seguin is\u00a0the executive director of Centre 105, a daytime drop-in centre and breakfast provider in Cornwall.\u00a0",
      "He says higher rents in recent years have made affordable homes harder to come by and that traffic at the centre has risen \"dramatically.\"\u00a0",
      "Hebert's death was heartbreaking in part because\u00a0\"had our community acted in a more swift manner,\u00a0perhaps this could have been avoided,\" Seguin said.\u00a0",
      "In his statement, Towndale said the city\u00a0originally hoped a temporary shelter space would be ready by the end of October. But one location didn't pan out, while the logistics for the nursing home building\u00a0took time to work out.",
      "That downtown building will have room for up to 20 residents and offer\u00a0addiction services, mental health supports and other wraparound care\u00a0the city has said is\u00a0key to helping the homeless.\u00a0",
      "\"A\u00a0shelter alone is not the\u00a0solution. We need a more robust plan,\" Towndale said in his statement.\u00a0",
      "Seguin said that while a shelter is often seen as a Band-Aid fix, \"we need some Band-Aids right now [because] we are in a really tough situation.\"",
      "The list of Cornwall residents identifying as homeless\u00a0numbered 77 in October 2021. That has since grown to 120, the city said on Friday.\u00a0",
      "The same day, Cornwall's chief administrative officer\u00a0Mathieu\u00a0Fleury\u00a0said in a news conference\u00a0that the nursing home building will have enough capacity for those still in encampments.\u00a0",
      "At Pointe Maligne\u00a0Park, where Diane Hebert was staying with her daughter, seven people remained as of Friday afternoon, while three were at another nearby camp, according to Unity Street Help Association, a local advocacy group.\u00a0",

      "She's constantly full speed ahead.",
      "The all-time winningest World Cup ski racer attended a Taylor Swift concert, visited a camp where a lodge was named after her, picked up an award at the ESPYs, stopped by to see her boyfriend/fellow ski racer Aleksander Aamodt Kilde in Norway and wrote an article for Time on singer Noah Kahan.",
      "On the training front, Shiffrin immersed herself in trail running, adapted to a coaching change and adopted a new attitude \u2014 \"relaxed and flowy,\" she called it \u2014 into her racing. The five-time World Cup overall winner has come to realize it's OK to build throughout a season and that she doesn't need to be at her elite best when the season kicks off Saturday with a giant slalom race in Soelden, Austria. Live coverage begins Saturday at 4 a.m. ET on CBCSports.ca, the CBC Sports app and CBC Gem.",
      "\"I'm trying to take a little bit more of an approach of giving myself time to build into my best form,\" the 28-year-old Shiffrin said Thursday in a Zoom call. \"If I feel amazing on Saturday, I'll take it. I'm not going to complain about that.\"",
      "WATCH | CBC Sports' 'Let's Go Racing' previews alpine season:",
      "One of the questions hovering around Shiffrin was motivation. More specifically, how does she find another source of inspiration after breaking Ingemar Stenmark's longtime World Cup wins record last season. Shiffrin's current total stands at 88 and counting (Stenmark had 86).",
      "Not even close to an issue, Shiffrin maintained. Her motivation will be as strong as ever in pursuing more World Cup overall titles. The women's record is six by Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria.",
      "\"So that motivation doesn't change because it just kind of resets every year,\" said Shiffrin, who's from Colorado. \"That's where my head's at.\"",
      "To take her training to another level, Shiffrin incorporated more trail running. It helped her report for training camp in arguably the best shape of her life. But then food poisoning hit her while training in Chile. And then when she got back home she caught a bug she couldn't shake. It zapped her strength.",
      "She's working with a new coach, too, in Karin Harjo \u2014 the former Canadian women's team coach \u2014\u00a0who replaces her longtime coach Mike Day. Shiffrin's mom, Eileen, still works with her as well.",
      "\"Karin's transitioning really quite seamlessly into the team,\" Shiffrin said. \"I'm really excited to move forward with Karin leading the charge.\"",
      "Shiffrin made sure to praise Day, too: \"I owe so much of the career that I've had to him and the work that he's done.\"",
      "The plan is for Shiffrin to try to add more speed races \u2014 super-Gs in particular \u2014 this season. But that's all schedule and health willing, of course.",

      "Shiffrin also spent quite a bit of time with Kilde, too, even scripting a dance together to ABBA's \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!\" while standing on the slopes in ski racing attire. Shiffrin also picked up the best female athlete award at the ESPY awards. That's not all \u2014 she had a lodge named after her at Camp Arrow Wood in Massachusetts. She said her lodge is right next to the one named for basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan.",
      "\"The offseason was really good,\" Shiffrin said. \"Mostly a lot of travel and some really, really fun events.\"",

    "paragraphs": [
      "The agony of love or, rather, of not knowing whether your beloved loves you (and, by corollary, whether you really love the one you\u2019re with) is treated metaphorically in Christos Nikou\u2019s \u201cFingernails,\u201d a fable that takes the kind of eccentric, delicate poetry of the filmmaker\u2019s lovely first feature, \u201cApples,\u201d a meditation on grief, memory and identity, and hammers it into applesauce.",
      "Like that earlier film, which was set in a kind of timeless, retro-futuristic dystopia without cellphones, and in which cassette tape players were used as therapeutic tools to treat an epidemic of amnesia \u2014 a world of not quite yesterday, today or tomorrow, but somewhere in between \u2014 \u201cFingernails\u201d takes place in a universe that only in some respects resembles our own. People are still tormented by the uncertainties of romance: Are we meant for each other? Will this end in heartache? And all the other mysteries of the ages that Taylor Swift has made a career out of singing about.",
      "But in the wake of some unspecified pandemic-like \u201ccrisis\u201d precipitated by the unpredictability of passion, a solution has been found. The technology has been discovered, at a place called the Love Institute, for couples to determine whether Cupid\u2019s aim is true. All it entails is ripping out a single fingernail from the hand of each partner \u2014 straight from the nail bed, without anesthesia and using pliers \u2014 and sticking the bloody hunks of keratin inside a device that resembles a Soviet-era microwave attached to an old cathode-ray-tube computer monitor. After a few seconds, the results are in: positive, meaning your love is real; negative, meaning it isn\u2019t; or \u201c50 percent,\u201d meaning one of you just ain\u2019t feeling it. (Though which one is heartless is impossible to say. Another form of suffering!)",
      "Jessie Buckley and Jeremy Allen White are the couple at the center of this tale, which ends up being exactly as nutty as it sounds. They\u2019ve already been tested: positive, and they have the certificate to prove it. But it isn\u2019t hard to tell, from such unscientific evidence as the way one\u2019s lip trembles or the little white lie the other tells, that there may be trouble in paradise. When Buckley\u2019s Anna takes a job administering tests and relationship training at the Institute, working with Riz Ahmed\u2019s handsome charmer Amir \u2014 all under the watchful eye of the Institute\u2019s goofy founder (Luke Wilson) \u2014 \u201cFingernails\u201d takes on the contours of a standard love triangle, albeit one whose circumstances we haven\u2019t quite seen the likes of before. The cast is excellent all around.",
      "It\u2019s not the familiarity of this setup that irks, but its silliness. If \u201cApples\u201d was odd, too, in a way that flirted with preciousness, it nevertheless managed to avoid outright illogic, performing a gingerly dance between the sublime and the stupid. A society that has late-model cars and recorded music, but no OxyContin? (Test subjects bite down on wooden dowels during the extraction, and film cameras are still in common use.) Exactly where/when is this taking place?",
      "Torture as a metaphor for love misses the mark as well. If Nikou, who co-wrote the screenplay with his \u201cApples\u201d collaborator Stavros Raptis and Sam Steiner, wants to mock rom-coms or unrequited romances, he\u2019s barking up the wrong tree. All he needs to do is listen to the 1967 Young Rascals song \u201cHow Can I Be Sure?\u201d to know where the pain comes from: It\u2019s not the knowing that hurts, but the not knowing.",

      "One look at Taylor Swift's Instagram profile and you know she's had a great few months: There are pictures of her latest rerelease, \"1989\"; snaps from the red carpet movie premiere for \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\"; and, of course, plenty of montages from the actual Eras Tour, which kicked off in March and won't end for another year. In the real world, she's been showing off her new beau, Travis Kelce, and showing up some of her former paramours.",
      "There's one thing she's not showing off \u2014 or at least not directly: How much money all this is making her.",
      "Last week, Bloomberg declared that Swift is \"officially\" a billionaire. The chronicler of wealth pegged Swift's net worth at $1.1 billion based on the aggregate value of her music catalog; earnings from touring and streaming; her real estate portfolio; and royalties from music sales.",
      "But unlike other celebrities who appear to brag about their riches \u2014 think Jay-Z rapping about putting \"a billion on the board\" or Kylie Jenner posing for a Forbes cover on her billionaire status \u2014 Swift hasn't said a thing about her wealth. Her camp did not reply to Bloomberg or Insider's requests for comment.",
      "Similarly, she hasn't released information on the Eras Tour's ticket sales, which Pollstar has estimated will conservatively reach $1.4 billion, making it the best-selling tour of all time and first to gross over $1 billion. While she's posted on social media about her film, she hasn't mentioned its record box-office sales either (which AMC's Adam Aron, by contrast, has repeatedly touted).",
      "The reason likely comes down to Swift's brand, something she's carefully molded over the past two decades.",
      "While some have called her calculating \u2014 a criticism that's garnered allegations of sexism \u2014 her silence on her wealth is simply good business.",
      "Swift has been through many eras, but her reputation has always been one of relatability. Swift has never seemed to care about being cool or untouchable. Instead, she's garnered legions of female fans thanks to her vulnerable anthems around heartbreak, the fact that she seems to care a lot, and her message of empowerment against corporate behemoths.",
      "She's never one to parade around in fancy cars and isn't too good for some \"seemingly ranch.\" Swift's private jets have made headlines, but her reps have said she often lends them out to her friends.",
      "As Kelce's dad recently said: She's a \"down-to-earth young woman.\" Or at least she presents that way.",
      "What wouldn't be relatable? The fact that Swift's net worth is bigger than some countries' GDPs.",
      "Through her tour, Swift has earned hundreds of millions of dollars on a show for which tickets at face value cost an average $254 in the US \u2014 more than double the average concert ticket price of $120, according to Pollstar. Many Swift fans paid much more, some in the thousands, for tickets on the secondary market \u2014 and then shelled out for expensive merch, like $70 hoodies.",
      "Swift is vocal about taking on Big Machine and rerecording her music. What she doesn't go into detail about is exactly how much that catalog could be worth. Bloomberg says it could be as much as $1 billion.",
      "And while the film version of her tour brings the concert experience to fans worldwide, including those who couldn't afford to attend, it is also making her a lot of money.",
      "Of course, all of these moves are another type of girl power, and the fact that Swift is as much a business genius as she is a lyrical one should be celebrated. Her most genius move of all may be not talking about it.",

      "The wait is over: Gannett, the biggest newspaper chain in the U.S., finally announced their hire for the highly coveted Taylor Swift reporter job at USA Today. The lucky Swiftie is 35-year-old Bryan West.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "It\u2019s no wonder USA Today was looking for a reporter to cover Swift full-time. The now-billionaire superstar has become an economic powerhouse this year with her record-breaking Eras Tour and the $100 million box office hit Eras Tour movie. She\u2019s reshaping the music industry with the stunning successes of her re-recording projects, most recently 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version). Swift\u2019s impact was even noted in a Federal Reserve economic report, while analysts call the boost she gives to local economies the \u201cTSwift Lift.\u201d\u00a0",
      "Her influence even extends to the NFL and beyond, as her romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce drives her legions of fans to the stadiums donning Chiefs jerseys. Swift\u2019s first appearance at a Chiefs game led Heinz to release a limited-edition \u201cKetchup and Seemingly Ranch\u201d sauce after the pop singer was spotted eating chicken with both sauces. And the genesis story of the couple\u2019s relationship has boosted sales at craft suppliers like Michaels after fans learned that Kelce gifted Swift a friendship bracelet after seeing her perform.",
      "West is, of course, a Swiftie. In his video resume, in which he listed 13 reasons why he\u2019s the right fit for the job, he described meeting Swift in person, joking, \u201cOur ears touched and I thought for a second, \u2018I could be straight.\u2019\u201d\u00a0",
      "But his credentials include serious journalism, too. After graduating from Northwestern University, West worked as a morning show planner, an investigative producer, and then a broadcast reporter in Phoenix. He\u2019s also won several awards for his work, including two Emmys, a Murrow, and a duPont.",
      "\u201cI would say this position\u2019s no different than being a sports journalist who\u2019s a fan of the home team,\u201d West told Variety of his new gig. \u201cI just came from Phoenix, and all of the anchors there were wearing Diamondbacks gear; they want the Diamondbacks to win. I\u2019m just a fan of Taylor and I have followed her her whole career, but I also have that journalistic background: going to Northwestern, winning awards, working in newsrooms across the nation.\u201d\u00a0",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s the fun of this job is that, yeah, you can talk Easter eggs, but it really is more of the seriousness, like the impact that she has on society and business and music,\u201d he added.",
      "When Gannett listed the job in September\u2014along with a Beyonc\u00e9 reporter position\u2014some speculated that it was merely a publicity stunt and the publication wasn\u2019t looking for a legitimate journalist for the role. After all, \u201canything she touches turns to gold,\u201d as one fan put it. But Michael Anastasi, the Tennessean\u2019s editor and Gannet\u2019s vice president of local news, told Variety that this assumption was wrong.",
      "Applicants \u201cran the gamut from veteran hard-news reporters, including at least one very established White House reporter, to Swifties who have blogs and are influencers\u2026and of course there were a number of fans who just were following their dreams and hoping to win the lottery,\u201d Anastasi said.",
      "\u201cBut what we ended up with was someone who I think has the great balance between being a veteran journalist who has serious news chops and someone who understands everything about Taylor\u2019s world and the universe that he\u2019s stepping into,\u201d he added.",
      "West will work out of the Tennesean\u2019s newsroom for USA Today and the chain\u2019s local daily papers, but he\u2019ll be doing more than just writing on Swift.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to be on video, going to be on social, going to be interacting with Swifties, and going to be out and about at tour stops, on red carpets, at the CMAs, wherever people are enjoying or reflecting on who Taylor Swift is,\u201d Ben Goad, Tennessean news director and West\u2019s manager, told Variety.\u00a0",

      "There\u2019s no real \u201cbad blood\u201d between the internet and journalist Bryan West \u2014 but there are a lot of questions about what his new role as Gannett\u2019s official Taylor Swift correspondent actually will entail.",
      "The newspaper chain hired West, 35, as its dedicated Swift reporter for USA Today \u2014 ending a search that started with a viral job posting in September.\u00a0",
      "Hundreds \u2014 including veteran news journalists and a White House beat reporter \u2014 applied for the role, Michael Anastasi, Gannett\u2019s vice president of local news, told Variety. The application sought a journalist who could \u201ccapture the music and cultural impact of Taylor Swift.\u201d It was posted as Swift continues to dominate headlines \u2014 from coverage of her widely successful Eras Tour (and subsequent concert movie) to recent buzz around her reported relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.",
      "But news of West\u2019s hiring, which was announced in Monday\u2019s Variety article and by The Tennessean newspaper of Nashville, was met with skepticism online by many journalists and Swifties alike.\u00a0",
      "Some said they had reservations about Gannett\u2019s hiring a self-proclaimed Swiftie, saying they hope West\u2019s coverage will hold pop culture\u2019s most powerful woman accountable. Many said they were disappointed that a man was hired to cover a woman who makes female-centric music. Others simply shared that they don\u2019t agree with the way West ranked Swift\u2019s music in his video application, which was shared to YouTube on Monday.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "\u201cNot a lot going on at the moment,\u201d West wrote Monday on X, referring to a popular shirt Swift wore in a music video for \u201c22.\u201d \u201cSo excited for this new chapter!\u201d",
      "When the job was unveiled, social media was abuzz with similar conversations \u2014 and memes. Gannett drew additional viral responses when it also said it plans to hire a dedicated Beyonc\u00e9 reporter, who has yet to be announced.\u00a0",
      "In West\u2019s video application, which had been viewed just over 9,000 times on YouTube as of Tuesday evening, he outlines 13 reasons he should be hired. Other than his love for Swift \u2014 whom he once met and took a picture with \u2014 he also shared how his knowledge of her would come in handy. ",
      "West shared that he felt he would be able to report on Swift without bias, listing some of her songs that he doesn\u2019t like.\u00a0In the interview with Variety, he elaborated on that point. He compared the role to that of sports journalists who are fans of the home teams they cover. He said that in Phoenix, where he previously worked, anchors and journalists would wear clothing featuring the Arizona Diamondbacks\u2019 baseball team logo and root for the team while they covered it.\u00a0",
      "But even though he shared his qualifications and enthusiasm, some still shared their reservations about his hiring.\u00a0",
      "\u201cthis job was a trap: media people don\u2019t respect this guy because he\u2019s a stan, the swifties don\u2019t respect him because he\u2019s not the right kind of stan,\u201d media writer Max Tani posted on X.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018Taylor Swift Reporter\u2019 role probably should have been filled by someone whose focus was the music industry (with a strong knowledge of Taylor Swift) and not a massive Swiftie who happens to be a reporter,\u201d a person posted to X.\u00a0",
      "Another joked: \u201cof course the most important thing for a reporter to have is an emotional, unyielding adoration for their subject.\u201d",
      "Some seemed to joke that some of the songs West listed as his \u201cleast favorite\u201d should be enough to get him to lose the role.",
      "\u201cFALSE GOD?! GET HIM FIRED,\u201d a person posted to X.",
      "But the most prominent complaint seemed to be about West\u2019s gender, with some saying Swift\u2019s ability to convey the female experience requires a female reporter.\u00a0",
      "\u201cone of the main components of taylor swift\u2019s whole brand/ personality is the fact that she is able to perfectly put into words the experience of womanhood\u2026 so who was the genius who decided to give a man this job???\u00a0 (especially a man who can\u2019t even name her songs correctly),\u201d a person posted to X, referring to how, in Variety's story, had West had called one of Swift\u2019s songs \u201cIt\u2019s Good to Have a Friend,\u201d rather than its correct title, which is \u201cIt\u2019s Nice to Have a Friend.\u201d ",
      "(West later clarified in a TikTok that he had gotten the song\u2019s name right, saying Variety had since corrected the error in its story. He said he appreciated other Swifties' dedication to accuracy.)",
      "One person online critical of West's hiring simply quoted Swift\u2019s lyrics from the song \u201cThe Man\u201d to describe how they felt upon seeing West\u2019s hiring.\u00a0",
      "\u201c\u2018I\u2019m so sick of running as fast as I can/Wondering if I\u2019d get there quicker if I was a man,\u2019\u201d a person wrote. \u201cHuh. Wonder who wrote that.\u201d",
      "Ben Goad, the news director of The Tennessean, expressed optimism about West and the future of the beat.\u00a0",

You know, it\u2019s not unprecedented to have somebody (dedicated to covering) someone who\u2019s a Senate candidate, or an athlete, like when LeBron James goes to Miami and has people just covering him.

      "When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Gannett referred to a Swift lyric from her hit \u201cShake It Off.\u201d",

      "Gannett, the biggest newspaper chain in the U.S., no longer has a blank space under the title of \u201cTaylor Swift\u00a0reporter.\u201d ",
      "The company has written in the name of Bryan West, a 35-year-old journalist from Arizona who has just moved to Nashville to fill the newly added, headline-making position. Starting Tuesday, West will be working out of the Tennessean\u2019s newsroom for\u00a0USA Today\u00a0and the chain\u2019s more than 200 local dailies, reporting on all things Swift \u2026 and only on all things Swift.",
      "When Gannett first announced the job search in September, it prompted a lot of soul-searching and hand-wringing among media types, who could be found openly arguing in public forums about whether hiring a dedicated Swift reporter (and also someone exclusively on the Beyonc\u00e9 beat) was a sign of the apocalypse or the most obviously defensible thing anyone in the business of covering entertainment has done in years.",
      "For anyone who\u00a0does\u00a0think that hiring a Swift beat reporter makes perfect sense, it may not be difficult to see why West was able to convince the company that, out of all the hundreds of applicants, they\u2019d never find another like him \u2026 that he\u2019s the only one of him\u2026 and baby that\u2019s the fun of him.",
      "\u201cI would say this position\u2019s no different than being a sports journalist who\u2019s a fan of the home team,\u201d says West. \u201cI just came from Phoenix, and all of the anchors there were wearing Diamondbacks gear; they want the Diamondbacks to win. I\u2019m just a fan of Taylor and I have followed her her whole career, but I also have that journalistic background: going to Northwestern, winning awards, working in newsrooms across the nation. I think that\u2019s the fun of this job is that, yeah, you can talk Easter eggs, but it really is more of the seriousness, like the impact that she has on society and business and music.\u201d",
      "At the outset of a call with\u00a0Variety\u00a0prior to the announcement going public, West was ready to engage with a journalist also on record for being a deep diver into Swift news, opinions and lore.",
      "\u201cI do think our biggest moment of contention is gonna be the secret Vault songs,\u201d he said within the first minute of the call \u2014 referring to the bonus tracks on the current blockbuster \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d \u2014 \u201cbecause I know you\u2019re a fan of \u2018Now That We Don\u2019t Talk,\u2019 and I\u2019m a huge fan of \u2018Say Don\u2019t Go.\u2019\u201d West even was able to cite a singular moment in \u201cSay Don\u2019t Go\u201d that makes it the most haunting of the new songs for him: \u201cWhen you listen to it, she screams a harmony of \u2018I said \u201cI love you\u201d\u2018 [in a bridge near the end of the track], and that\u2019s why I really like it: It\u2019s the harmony she screams that\u2019s muted.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s the kind of obscure observation that may make West a man after a million Swifties\u2019 own heart s\u2026 if that core demographic for the superstar can be persuaded to pick up a newspaper. And by \u201cpick up a paper,\u201d of course we mean engage with Gannett\u2019s dailies digitally, as newspapers expand their outreach with more stories produced as video content. ",
      "That\u2019s something West says gave him an advantage in the search, as he was able to highlight his history of having worked for an NBC affiliate in Phoenix, often acting as \u201ca one-man band\u201d toting a camera and shooting his own interviews.",
      "Michael Anastasi, the Tennessean\u2019s editor and also the Gannett chain\u2019s VP of local news, says cynics were wrong to suppose that the company put up the job posting for the publicity of it and wouldn\u2019t be looking for a real journalist to fill the role\u2026 even if not all the aspirants had reporting chops.",
      "\u201cWe were very pleased with the caliber of the pool that we had,\u201d Anastasi says. \u201cI think if we ended up hiring five more people, we would have highly qualified candidates\u201d for all the positions. \u201cIt ran the gamut from veteran hard-news reporters, including at least one very established White House reporter, to Swifties who have blogs and are influencers \u2026 and of course there were a number of fans who just were following their dreams and hoping to win the lottery. But what we ended up with was someone who I think has the great balance between being a veteran journalist who has serious news chops and someone who understands everything about Taylor\u2019s world and the universe that he\u2019s stepping into.\u201d",
      "Adds Ben Goad, the Tennessean news director who will serve as West\u2019s direct boss, \u201cThis is not a traditional \u2018we\u2019re going to write three print stories a week and draw a paycheck\u2019 type of beat. He\u2019s going to be on video, going to be on social, going to be interacting with Swifties, and going to be out and about at tour stops, on red carpets, at the CMAs, wherever people are enjoying or reflecting on who Taylor Swift is. There\u2019s no shortage of things to write. You know, it\u2019s not unprecedented to have somebody (dedicated to covering) someone who\u2019s a Senate candidate, or an athlete, like when LeBron James goes to Miami and has people just covering him. So I think there\u2019s precedent for it. But also, I think, we\u2019re taking a pretty bold step here, and I\u2019m very optimistic for how it\u2019s going to turn out.\u201d",
      "West confirms that he is going to be out and about at CMA Awards-related red carpets in Nashville as part of his first week on the job. But if his job is covering just Swift, does that mean he\u2019ll be asking country stars what their favorite Vault track on \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d is? He\u2019s not tipping his hand, there.",
      "West has met Swift once, in the backstage at the Phoenix-area opening night of the \u201cReputation\u201d tour in 2018 (pictured above). As a reporter for the NBC affiliate in town, he was so renowned for his Swiftie-ness that the anchors would sometimes rib him on-air. ",
      "\u201cThe newscasters would make fun of me, saying things like, \u2018We\u2019re surprised Bryan didn\u2019t call in sick to work today because Taylor released a new album.\u2019 I put those (jibes) together, sent it to her team, and said, \u2018Hey, just so you know, Taylor\u2019s got a local news reporter that\u2019s a fan. Tree (Paine, Swift\u2019s publicist) wrote me the morning of the concert and said, \u2018Taylor wants to meet you. How soon can you get out here?\u2019 I went home, I changed, I went to Walgreens and printed out a headshot of me and signed it \u2018from your favorite local news reporter,\u2019 and I sat in the parking lot for four hours until she said, \u2018Hey, your passes to go backstage are at will-call.\u2019\u201d (In his video resume, West recalls the moment and quips, \u201cOur ears touched and I thought for a second, I could be straight.\u201d)",
      "The submission that West sent in to Gannett naturally includes that photo opp, but also elements like a short list of serious story ideas \u2014 like, for instance, how Swift has economically impacted the friendship bracelet industry. Over the course of the interviewing process, he subsequently expanded that to a two-page PDF of story ideas.",
      "He\u2019s not worried taking on his shift as Swift\u2019s seemingly biggest year draws to a close and 2024 has her largely overseas. Besides covering how the Eras Tour might have different wrinkles in global markets, he\u2019s particularly excited about the expected release of a \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d of \u201cReputation,\u201d which he quite correctly and objectively identifies as one of her best albums.",
      "He can indulge in conspiracy theories with the best of them \u2014 he had one having to do with Swift sending out clues to her fans via her fingernails that he would only share off the record. But West also has a fundamentally serious side that he shared in his resume, as somebody who became sober and made major life changes five years ago.",
      "\u201cI was at a crossroads where I felt like I could live in this darkness or I could wake up and try and be a better person,\u201d West says, \u201cso part of that for me was stepping back from news. I joined a local CrossFit gym that works with people in sobriety and recovery. And then I started working for a company where I traveled the U.S. working with high school student leaders \u2014 and I loved that because I could geek out and I want to be known for being a good person. And that was me stepping back from news. \u2026 And I told them, jokingly, \u2018If I could report on Taylor Swift every day.\u2019 So it almost felt like a manifestation when that same colleague texted me and said, Hey, your dream job just became available.\u2019\u201d",
      "Is a Swiftie destined to be a softie, when it comes to news that might cast the star in a harsher light? West addressed the objectivity issue in his video submission for the job, saying he would be able to report fairly on the superstar \u2014 and be critical if necessary \u2014 with a slightly comical example: He said the proof was in his citation of three Swift songs that he can\u2019t stand: \u201cStay Stay Stay,\u201d \u201cFalse God\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Nice to Have a Friend.\u201d ",
      "Now that his video resume is being made public, he\u2019s a little worried fans might \u201ccancel\u201d him for throwing those three tracks under the bus. (For the record, his favorite songs are: \u201cAll Too Well (10 Minute Version),\u201d \u201cLong Live,\u201d an extended concert version of \u201cI Did Something Bad,\u201d \u201cDeath by a Thousand Cuts\u201d and \u201cWildest Dreams,\u201d for starters.)",
      "There will, of course, be journalists who believe this is strictly a fanboy position, or that even if West does have the potential to be a hardboiled Swiftie, it\u2019s still an insult to serious news reporting when this kind of job is being created as traditional positions are being slashed left and right in the newspaper industry. Many have cited the significant cuts undertaken by the chain in the second half of 2022. It was reported then that a big second-quarter loss resulted first in the layoff of 400 employees and 400 open positions being left vacant, followed later by another 6% reduction.",
      "But Anastasi says that a vital part of keeping the business healthy is creating new jobs even as others go away. \u201cI oversee all of the newsrooms across the country for Gannett,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very important to note that I\u2019ve hired hundreds of local journalists in the past few months, at all of our papers \u2014 big, medium, small \u2014 and that these aren\u2019t positions that are supplanting other positions in our company. This is part of a very deliberate transformational strategy to become the company that we need to become to be growing, thriving and in position to serve all of our local communities across the country into the future.\u201d",
      "West is not guaranteed to get interviews with Swift, who rarely does interviews anymore. If he does land one, he has a backlog of mysteries to plum, as any major or minor fan would. Like: \u201cI love \u2018Wildest Dreams.\u2019 I can\u2019t believe that was her heartbeat. I want to ask her, \u2018Were you in the doctor\u2019s office and they were just taking a pulse, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Hold on, I\u2019ve got to record this\u2019?\u201d",

The division dominated by Aaron Rodgers for so long now belongs to Jared Goff and the Lions.\u00a0 Fueled by Dan Campbell and a defense you'd hate to be on the other side of, the Lions rebuild is in full effect.\u00a0 Do the Lions have what it takes to go all the way to the Super Bowl? That remains to be seen, but we're going to have fun watching them try. If there ever was an NFL underdog we're rooting for, it would be this team.",
      "Taylor Swift is the only thing bigger than the NFL: Taylor and Travis officially made it official this past weekend, hard launching their romance with surprise cameos on SNL and a public moment of PDA that sent Swifties and the Chiefs Kingdom swooning. As if fans weren't already on the Chiefs bandwagon, Swift has made fans of entire universe of 12-year-old girls. If they weren't already tuning in, they are now. With booming ratings, windbreaker sales galore and Taylor spotting at Arrowhead Stadium, Taylor Swift has proved that the only thing bigger than the NFL is her.",
      "That 49ers defense is dangerous:\u00a0Brock Purdy silenced naysayers last season when he took over after both QBs Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo suffered season-ending injuries. Coach Shanahan traded Lance and gave Purdy the starting job this season with little trepidation that the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft had what it takes. Shanahan's decision has paid off two weeks in, the team is undefeated and Purdy shows full command of the team. But the 49ers Nick Bosa-led defense is what could take this team to the Super Bowl. The Niners come into Week 7 with just loss. If this team can stay healthy, they have the makings of a Super Bowl contender and one of \u00a0the most fun teams to watch this season.",

As if fans weren't already on the Chiefs bandwagon, Swift has made fans of entire universe of 12-year-old girls. If they weren't already tuning in, they are now. With booming ratings, windbreaker sales galore and Taylor spotting at Arrowhead Stadium, Taylor Swift has proved that the only thing bigger than the NFL is her.",
      "That 49ers defense is dangerous:\u00a0Brock Purdy silenced naysayers last season when he took over after both QBs Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo suffered season-ending injuries. Coach Shanahan traded Lance and gave Purdy the starting job this season with little trepidation that the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft had what it takes. Shanahan's decision has paid off two weeks in, the team is undefeated and Purdy shows full command of the team. But the 49ers Nick Bosa-led defense is what could take this team to the Super Bowl. The Niners come into Week 7 with just loss. If this team can stay healthy, they have the makings of a Super Bowl contender and one of \u00a0the most fun teams to watch this season.",

      "Patrick Mahomes circled the Frankfurt game on his calendar when the NFL schedule was announced.",
      "\"It\u2019s really cool just to be on this stage, the world stage, in Germany,\" the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback said Friday. \"I\u2019m excited to be able to play out here.\"",
      "The Chiefs are excited, too, because the game against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday at Deutsche Bank Park is a big step for an organization with global ambitions to become the \"world\u2019s team.\"",
      "The blueprint is simple enough. They have won two of the past four Super Bowls, they have dynamic stars in reigning MVP Mahomes and All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce, and the NFL has prioritized international growth. Taylor Swift just adds to their good timing.",
      "\"We feel like this is our era,\" Chiefs president Mark Donovan said. \"Based on the timing, the success and the stars, it\u2019s a responsibility to take advantage of this. If we don\u2019t aggressively take advantage of this, that\u2019s a failure.\"",
      "The Chiefs have commercial rights in Germany under the league\u2019s global markets program, meaning they can sign corporate sponsorship deals, hold events to attract fans and sell merchandise as they do in their home markets. That country list includes Austria and Switzerland, as well as Mexico.",
      "The NFL added a 17th game to the schedule to facilitate playing more games abroad, and it is reviewing Spain and Brazil as future hosts, one of them possibly for the 2024 season.",
      "\"It can be looked at as maybe arrogant. I like to look at it as ambitious, but we want to be the world\u2019s team,\" Donovan said. \"We think the opportunity exists today for us to set a foothold that we are the world\u2019s team, that people look at the Chiefs as an international representation of the NFL.\"",
      "They say they have some numbers to back it up, too. The NFL told the Chiefs that they are No. 2 in \"revenue generated from the international markets,\" Donovan said. He declined to say which team is first, and the NFL didn\u2019t comment.",
      "The Chiefs have played two other regular-season international games, winning in Mexico City in 2019 and in London four years earlier.",
      "This one is different, though. The global markets program only took effect in January 2022, the Chiefs have another Lombardi Trophy, and Mahomes is increasingly the face of the league following the retirement of Tom Brady.",
      "\"From our standpoint, we\u2019re going to be aggressive in looking at additional markets, and we\u2019re going to be aggressive in looking at additional games,\" Donovan said. \"We think games are the best way to have that foothold activation.\"",
      "With the league studying Spain and Brazil, those two countries are atop Kansas City\u2019s list of potential next markets, Donovan said.",
      "The Chiefs are \"talking to the league\" about ways to play more international games. As is, they are a big draw around the U.S., so other teams don\u2019t want to give up the revenue that comes with a visit from Chiefs Kingdom. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, for example, rejected the Chiefs as the \"away\" team for their game in Munich last season, Donovan said.",
      "Kansas City is the designated \"home\" team in Frankfurt, as will be the New England Patriots next week against the Indianapolis Colts.",
      "The Chiefs have spent about $1 million in preparation and fan events for Frankfurt \u2014 that includes docking a Chiefs-themed yacht in the Main River. Over the past nearly three years, the team has spent about $3 million on its international efforts, with the majority invested in Germany, Donovan said.",
      "\"It\u2019s going to pay off over time,\" he said.",
      "The late Lamar Hunt was an early proponent of going international. The Chiefs have played preseason games in Japan, Mexico and Germany.",
      "A memorable preseason game took place in August 1990 when the Chiefs played the Los Angeles Rams at Olympic Stadium in West Berlin after the Berlin Wall fell and just before reunification. Media reports said there were 55,000 fans.",
      "Growing an international fan base these days \"is much easier to do now because of social media, because of the digital delivery of games,\" Chiefs Chairman and CEO Clark Hunt said this week.",
      "As for becoming the world\u2019s team, Donovan acknowledges it won\u2019t be easy.",
      "\"It\u2019s a big, audacious goal,\" he said",

      "How's this for a trend? The Kansas City Chiefs are 5-0 straight up (SU) and 4-1 against the spread (ATS) since Taylor Swift first attended a K.C. game in Week 3 in support of her current interest in Travis Kelce.",
      "It's a stat that could certainly be enjoyed by a bookmaker who also loves the entertainment industry. So FOX Sports tapped into DraftKings director of sportsbook operations Johnny Avello to get his thoughts on the whole Travis and Taylor to-do.",
      "Make an Impression",
      "Swift has attended four of the Chiefs' games during their current five-game SU winning streak. The only one she missed was K.C.'s 27-20 victory at Minnesota, with the Chiefs covering as 3.5-point favorites on Oct. 8. Kelce scored touchdowns in two of those games, including in a monster Sunday effort as Kansas City beat the Los Angeles Chargers 31-17 to cover as 5.5-point home favorites.",
      "Kelce had 10 catches for a whopping 179 yards. Avello ostensibly likened it to the whole high school boyfriend-girlfriend scenario.",

      "\"Mahomes wants to make this guy look good in front of his girl. You put the two of them together, and Mahomes is getting Kelce more targets,\" Avello said.",
      "\"It's a great story.\"",
      "Top of the Props",
      "For years, Avello posted odds on the Academy Awards. That was for entertainment purposes only, until just recently, when he's been allowed to do so legally in some of DraftKings' jurisdictions. So anything that ties betting to entertainment is right in his wheelhouse.\u00a0",
      "Over the past few weeks, Avello has seen a significant boost in betting on Kelce player props, a Swifties effect, if you will. It's receded a bit lately, but still in Week 7, Kelce took the second-most tickets of any player in DraftKings' Anytime Touchdown market. That was a win for bettors.",
      "Kelce also continues to be well-bet each week in Player to Score First TD and in Player to Score Two or More TDs markets. He ranked fifth in both categories in Week 7, though he didn't deliver in either.",
      "And of course, as noted above, Kansas City hasn't lost on the field and is 4-1 ATS since Swift hitched her wagon to the Chiefs. It's not a trend you want to burst your bankroll on, but Avello sees it as a net positive.",
      "\"She's good for the game itself,\" he said. \"Fans are now watching football who weren't watching it before. It's good for the NFL and good for betting. I hope she continues to come to more Chiefs games.\"",

      "The four-time first-team All-Pro is averaging nearly 100 receiving yards per game since Swift started attending his games back in September, and the Chiefs as a whole are 5-0 (4-1 against the spread) in that timeframe. In the two games Kelce has played this season without Swift in attendance, he is averaging fewer than 50 yards per game.",

Both brothers have repeatedly said publicly how much they respect and admire Reid, who is considered one of the most beloved head coaches in this generation of the NFL.",
      "[Travis Kelce dazzled in Week 7. Is he 'showing off' for Taylor Swift?]",
      "Reid even met Swift, a Philadelphia-area native who publicly declared herself an Eagles fan before the start of the dating rumors connecting her and Travis Kelce, years ago when he was still coaching in Philadelphia. He said he even remembers her cheering from a suite at Lincoln Financial Field, just like she now does for Reid's \u2014 and Travis' \u2014 home games at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City."

      "\"You either go with what your mind is saying or you go with what your heart is saying,\" the 21-year-old fan told CBC Radio's Tapestry.",
      "\"I find a lot of the times, go with the heart.... And I personally think that's what Taylor does all the time, is she leads with her heart.\"",
      "There's been a fervent fan base surrounding Swift and her brand of music since she burst onto the scene in 2006. But more recently, that devotion has risen to new heights, particularly given the record-breaking success of her worldwide Eras Tour concerts and movie.",
      "And it's a relatively common experience for that devotion to border on spiritual for some fans, according to researcher Kathleen Riddell.",
      "\"[Fans] talk about ... how they adore and worship the celebrity,\" Riddell, who recently completed her PhD\u00a0with\u00a0the University of Waterloo's religious studies department,\u00a0told CBC Radio's Tapestry.",
      "\"The reason I think that they do this is that religion is really the best analogous experience in order to articulate, one, how they feel about the celebrity, but two, about their experiences with their celebrity or their fans.\"",
      "Gruppuso, of Stouffville, Ont., has been a Swift fan for most of her life. Her first memory of the star goes back to the 2009 film Hannah Montana: The Movie, in which Swift had a guest role.",
      "Being connected to a community of Swifties has allowed\u00a0Gruppuso meet other fans from all walks of life. Swift's massive repertoire also offers a song to help her\u00a0process just about anything, she says.",
      "Those anchor points have helped Gruppuso understand herself better and even made her coming-out experience easier, for example.",
      "\"She's never afraid to write a song about anything,\" she said. \"Whatever she experiences in life, whether it could be, you know, a good thing or a bad thing, she writes about it.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Miri Makin\u00a0loves Taylor Swift's music so much, she co-founded a Toronto-based company to celebrate it.",
      "TSwift Dance Party Canada, which started in November 2021 with co-founder Victoria Morton, organizes events across the country that bring together Swifties as a\u00a0DJ exclusively spins Swift's discography \u2014 all while raising money for charity.",
      "\"I think I've always been kind of jealous that I didn't have that built-in community with people who cared about the exact same thing that I did passionately, and now I do,\" Makin\u00a0said.",
      "Like Gruppuso, Makin\u00a0says she feels like she's grown up with Swift. Makin is two years younger than the performer, who is 33, and says it feels like many of her milestones have aligned with Swift's.",
      "\"Any time she's written an album, it's come out a year or two later, which basically means that I'm going through whatever she was going through age wise when she wrote her music,\" she said.",
      "We find ourselves connected to celebrities and art when they reflect what we want to see in ourselves, says Maja Djikic, a personality psychologist and executive director of the Self-Development Laboratory at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.",
      "Fans use an artist's work \u2014 whether it's music, a book or another creation \u2014 to positively remind themselves of their \"potential.\"",
      "\"Somebody could look at Taylor Swift and see her immense creativity or the freedom that she expresses when she's on stage, and that part of themselves ... could be saying, 'Oh, yes, I could do that,'\" Djikic told Tapestry.",
      "The relationship fans form with celebrities can offer a sense of intimacy even if there's no expectation or belief that the star will reciprocate. That's in some ways good, she\u00a0says, because there's no possibility for rejection. On the other hand, that relationship can be simply a business transaction.",
      "\"There is this person who might have economic incentive to do things that makes us believe that there is intimacy when really there is none,\" Djikic said.",
      "\"This kind of cultivation of potential intimacy ... could be sort of this dark side of fandom, because I don't imagine Taylor Swift is really looking for a lot of friends among her fans.\"",
      "Thousands of people have turned up for Makin's Swift-themed parties. It's an audience whose members are deeply in sync with each other, Makin says.",
      "She recalls one recent Toronto event that saw more than 3,500 Swifties\u00a0take to the dance floor. During All Too Well \u2014 the 10-minute version, a fan favourite \u2014 Makin looked out over the crowd to see everyone singing along. Swaying, she put up her hands, making a heart with her fingers, just as Swift does on tour.",
      "\"And I looked out and 3,500 people \u2014 I kid you not, every single person in the entire room \u2014 within 10 seconds had put up their own hands and were all just waving in time, eyes closed, singing the lyrics at the top of their lungs,\" she recalled.",
      "\"You see it at a Taylor Swift concert, but other concerts I've been to, you don't even see that kind of unanimous love for someone.\"",
      "Part of Swift's success in courting such a devoted fan base is through the different \"eras\" of her career, Riddell says. For example, Swift firmly began as a country artist before moving into pop. And recently, with her Folklore and Evermore albums, the artist leaned into a more stripped-back, folk-style sound.",
      "Riddell, who has studied fans of deceased artists John Lennon and Johnny Cash for her PhD dissertation, says the more distinct periods a celebrity has in their career, the more fans will gravitate toward them.",
      "\"When there's such a span of different ways the fan can identify with a celebrity, it's more likely that the fan will recognize themselves in the celebrity because there is such a multitude of locations of identification,\" she said.",
      "As for Gruppuso, she says that she's part of\u00a0Swiftie fandom for life \u2014 regardless of what future eras have to bring.",
      "\"It's very hard to break that connection when you feel so strongly about her music and her as a person,\" she said. \"You feel like you're going to be there for as long as she's writing music \u2014 which, based on what she said, will happen for the rest of her life.",

      "What counts as a business expense?",
      "Depending on who you ask\u2014or how closely your manager is keeping an eye on you\u2014the answer could be as straightforward as an ergonomic desk chair or as outlandish as Taylor Swift tickets.\u00a0",
      "Last month, Brex, the spending platform whose flagship product is business credit cards, analyzed the past year of expenses made by 20,000 companies\u2014mostly in tech\u2014that use its platform. Turns out well-compensated workers have an extra-loose definition of \u201cbusiness expense.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s not a big deal, Michael Tannenbaum, CFO-COO of the company, tells Fortune. And even the more outlandish and flashy purchases might actually be reasonable, he says.\u00a0",
      "Some of the most shocking charges Brex users made this year include:",
      "Tannenbaum characterizes Brex\u2019s user base as forward-thinking. The fact that each of the expenses on this list was approved is also a sign of our current work climate\u2014a remote world in which the power remains in the employee\u2019s hands, Tannenbaum says.\u00a0",
      "Each of these expenses were made, presumably, by a worker who believed it aligned with their company\u2019s general ethos. \u201cThat dictates a lot of these things,\u201d Tannenbaum says. Still, each company has different expectations, and they give their workers a different level of freedom to cash out on the company\u2019s dime.",
      "The tightest-leash scenario is \u201cwhere a few employees have a [company] card, and everything\u2019s done by reimbursement, and you can\u2019t get reimbursed if it\u2019s not approved,\u201d Tannenbaum says.\u00a0",
      "On the opposite end are more laissez-faire leaders who believe \u201cpolicing expenses is not a good use of my time, and employees shouldn\u2019t have to worry about being out-of-pocket for work expenses.\u201d\u00a0",
      "The latter approach seems more reasonable to Tannenbaum, who says it\u2019s worth it to have a strong culture\u2014even if that means the occasional employee is spending too much money on coffee.",
      "He\u2019s been in the room long enough to be able to provide a scenario in which every expense on the list could be justified\u2014yes, even the Beyonc\u00e9 tickets, which could be feasibly used to lure a client.\u00a0",
      "Additionally, the dominance of remote work\u2014which Brex, a remote-first company, dines out on\u2014has led to an avalanche of new expenses that would otherwise be absorbed by the office, he says. ",
      "That can run the gamut from purchasing technology for work to running up mailing or document-processing costs. The latter is something Tannenbaum has experienced thanks to his role as a named officer on Brex\u2019s money transmission licenses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m on many licenses, and I have to get notaries and send stuff through mail and FedEx for state licenses, which I would\u2019ve done in the office,\u201d Tannenbaum says. \u201cOr there would\u2019ve been someone doing it for me. Now I\u2019m paying for it myself.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, the Great Resignation (which became the Big Stay) has planted us in a veritable employee market right now, Tannenbaum says, adding that giving workers leeway to expense perhaps not-quite-business-related perks is a recruiting and retention tactic. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do things that are more employee-friendly. We\u2019re going to give people the benefit of the doubt\u2014that\u2019s the prevailing ethos,\u201d he says.\u00a0",
      "That\u2019s especially true with tech companies, which Tannenaum says tend to be transparency-focused and employee-friendly. \u201cYou\u2019re less likely to find finance leaders who are stringent on rules; why spend time quibbling on $5 at Starbucks? Generally, it\u2019s about culture and whether you want your employees to feel like they\u2019re empowered or being watched.\u201d\u00a0",
      "\u201cThere are big benefits for white-collar CFOs to ignore small details,\u201d he adds.",
      "But a slightly-too-loose employee could risk losing their job or being put on notice for running up a tab\u2014especially if a company is operating on thin margins. Expensing even a few dollars can seem small, but it can also be very emotional, and the transaction can become nasty between workers and leaders very quickly, Tannenbaum adds.\u00a0",
      "\u201cGen Zers, young workers, maybe don\u2019t understand. When in doubt, or if they haven\u2019t developed a sense of right or wrong, they should ask their manager,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a place I\u2019d take a risk.\u201d",

The self-described \u201cbaddie\u201d with the \u201cAnnie\u201d hair brings a casual New York cool to the shifty, club-ready sound of the drill subgenre and clearly has no time for boys who are liars, losers and, in the slang of her breakthrough single, \u201cmunches.\u201d Her first tour is in support of Doja Cat, a chameleonic artist who scored rap\u2019s first No. 1 hit in over a year with \u201cPaint the Town Red,\u201d a song that pushes back at her critics and underscores how willing she is to court controversy.

Alongside collaborators including JPEGMafia, Pink Siifu, Moor Mother and DJ Haram, the pair rap with East Coast precision and expand the sonic palette of their dystopian chronicles, nodding to James Baldwin and MF Doom one minute and throwing bon mots like molotov cocktails (\u201cLost that university stipend, tossed ricin in USPS for the excitements\u201d) the next.

Tjay\u2019s air of melancholy took on a new density after he was shot seven times during an attempted robbery in June 2022.

That anything-goes approach spiraled out of control on their bloated \u201cPink Tape,\u201d which samples Eurodance hits and WWE themes and finds Uzi covering System of a Down and enlisting metal acts as collaborators.

      "The Eras Tour has become known for Swift revealing \u201csurprise songs.\u201d At each show, she sings\u00a0 two surprise acoustic versions of often lesser-known tracks. Of roughly 161 options, Swift has played 106 songs. That\u2019s 17 from Red (Taylor's Version), 15 from Speak Now (Taylor's Version), 14 from Fearless (Taylor's Version), 10 from Taylor Swift, 11 from 1989, 9 from Midnights, 7 from evermore, 9 from Lover, 6 from folklore, and 7 from Reputation.\u00a0",
      "The next leg of the tour will likely see Swift perform some of the more than 50 songs on the list. And at the last show on the first U.S. leg of her tour, Swift announced that she would be releasing the re-recorded \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d of 1989, so the new songs \u201cfrom the vault,\u201d that almost made the original cut and are now available, are eligible as surprise tracks.

      "Pop music supernova Taylor Swift has officially joined the three-comma club, Bloomberg News reports. On the eve of the release of 1989 TV\u2014and amid a record-breaking tour and box office bonanza\u2014the singer-songwriter\u2019s net worth sits at an estimated $1.1 billion.",
      "Bloomberg\u2019s analysis takes into account the estimated value of Swift\u2019s music catalog and her five homes, as well as earnings from streaming, music sales, and concerts. The news outlet says the calculation is likely conservative and is based \u201conly on assets and earnings that could be confirmed or traced from publicly disclosed figures.\u201d Swift did not respond to Bloomberg\u2019s request for comment.",
      "The bulk of her wealth is tied to her impressive catalog, which Bloomberg values at $400 million. (And that\u2019s the music she\u2019s released since 2019\u2014the music she made before that is now held by Shamrock Holdings. If all of her music is included, the value reaches $1 billion on its own, per Bloomberg.) Another $370 million is tied to ticket sales and merchandise, while Spotify and YouTube earnings account for $120 million, and her five homes are valued at $110 million. It is possible she has other sources of wealth that are not public.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s one of the few entertainers to reach that status based on music and performing alone, the result of work and talent, but also canny marketing and timing,\u201d Bloomberg notes.",
      "Speculation on when, not if, Swift would officially crossover into billionaire-dom has abounded since the Eras Tour kicked off with unprecedented demand for tickets. The tour itself, which is currently slated to run through the end of 2024, is set to rack in well over $1 billion in ticket sales, much of which makes its way to Swift.",
      "The Eras Tour has worked as something of a marketing machine for her other projects. While many artists make most of their money off of touring, Swift is the rare musician who also makes a significant amount from digital and physical music sales. Her devoted fan base makes sure of that (her most recent release, Speak Now TV, debuted in the midst of the tour and sold 716,000 copies, including nearly 270,000 on vinyl LP). ",
      "And with the fourth re-record of her first six studio albums set to release Friday, the 33-year-old is bringing in even more money. Analysts expect 1989 TV to be one of the biggest albums of the year in terms of sales.",
      "But Swift, never one to settle for just one or two projects at a time, is also benefitting from movie ticket sales. Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour has brought in around $165 million at the worldwide box office in the past two weeks, thanks to support from fans and other moviegoers curious to get a taste of the Eras Tour for themselves. That makes it the highest-grossing concert tour movie of all time.",
      "Bloomberg also credits Swift\u2019s billionaire status, partly, to her shrewd negotiations around streaming. The pop star took her music off Spotify in 2014\u2014when the original 1989 was released\u2014demanding the company compensate artists better for their work. She took Apple to task a few years later, resulting in changes at both streamers.",
      "Swift\u2019s Eras Tour was a boon not just to the singer, but to the cities she performed in. The Eras Tour added $4.3 billion to the U.S.\u2019s gross domestic product throughout the first 53 shows, according to estimates from Bloomberg Economics. She even got a shoutout from the U.S. Federal Reserve.",
      "\u201cTaken together, Swift Inc. is essentially a multinational conglomerate with the world\u2019s most devoted customer base, its most charismatic CEO and significant economic power,\u201d Bloomberg writes. ",

      "Moviegoers had many other options to choose from. The video game adaptation \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d repeated its first-place ranking, followed by \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d still going strong. Sofia Coppola\u2019s \u201cPriscilla \u201d expanded nationwide and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d returned to IMAX screens. Several well-received indies opened as well. ",
      "But this was the weekend that Warner Bros. and Legendary\u2019s \u201c Dune: Part Two\u201d was supposed to open, before the SAG-AFTRA strike prompted many studios to shuffle release dates in anticipation of a lengthy dispute that has stopped movie stars from promoting their films. The \u201cDune\u201d sequel starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya was pushed to March 2024, and no major blockbusters moved in to take its Nov. 3 spot.",

      "\u201cIt's hard to reverse engineer, but \u2018Dune 2\u2019 would have certainly been the No. 1 movie and it would have been a bigger overall weekend,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cThe strikes have had a profound impact on this marketplace. But this left a lot of opportunity for films like \u2018Priscilla,\u2019 \u2018The Holdovers\u2019 and \u2018Radical\u2019 to get more of a spotlight.\u201d",
      "In its second weekend, \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d picked up an additional $19.4 million to take first place, according to studio estimates Sunday. It's a hefty 76% drop from its first weekend. That's not unexpected given that the movie is also streaming on Peacock and that viewership for films targeting intense and niche fandoms are often wildly frontloaded. But taking in $217 million globally against a reported $20 million production budget makes it a hit for Universal Pictures and Blumhouse.",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" took second place, with fourth weekend earnings at an estimated $13.5 million for the AMC release. Playing only on Thursdays through Sundays, the film has made an astonishing $231.1 million globally to date. ",

The hope is that A24 release will have a long life into awards season.",
      "\u201c The Holdovers,\u201d a Focus Features release, also expanded slightly to 64 theaters this weekend, where it grossed an additional $600,000. Next weekend the New England-set period drama starring Paul Giamatti as a curmudgeonly prep school teacher will expand to over 800 locations. ",
      "A handful of smaller films made their theatrical debuts this weekend, including Meg Ryan\u2019s \u201cWhat Happens Later,\u201d released by Bleecker Street; and Sundance gems \u201c Radical \u201d and \u201c All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt.\" ",
      "The biggest of the batch was \u201c Radical,\u201d which is based on a true story about a teacher in a Mexican border city and stars Eugenio Derbez. The warmly reviewed Pantelion release opened in 419 locations and made $2.7 million. ",

      "The effects of the ongoing strike at the box office are not easily quantifiable. Up to this point, it\u2019s mainly meant that stars without interim agreements haven\u2019t been able to promote their films. \u201cPriscilla\u201d was one of the exceptions and Elordi and Spaeny have been able to do interviews and appear on talk shows to drum up awareness.",
      "Next weekend will be an interesting test, as Marvel and Disney release \u201cThe Marvels\u201d without months of appearances from stars like Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris and Lashana Lynch preceding it. It is possible a resolution between the actors\u2019 guild and the major entertainment companies may come this week, but it's unclear if that will have any impact on \u201cThe Marvels.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Not so long before her platinum-selling single \u201cTennessee Orange\u201d became inescapable on country radio, this year scoring Megan Moroney her first-ever CMA nominations (song of the year and artist of the year), the up-and-comer was attending the University of Georgia. The life of a country musician? It wasn't supposed to happen.",
      "\u201cIt is truly crazy because I went to school to be an accountant,\u201d Moroney tells The Associated Press. \u201cAnd here we are.\u201d",
      "Fate clearly had other plans. When she was a freshman, Moroney opened for singer John Langston at a sorority event, performing a few Miranda Lambert covers. There, she met Chase Rice, who told her she could open for her at the Georgia Theater \u2014 but she needed to write an original song, first. ",
      "\"So, I wrote my first song, called \u2018Stay A Memory,' and I performed it,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn't put it out, but maybe one day I'll tease it.\u201d",
      "After that show, she knew she wanted to move to Nashville and pursue music \u2014 but first, she switched her major to focus on music business and interned with Sugarland's Kristian Bush, who'd later produce her stellar debut album, 2023's \u201cLucky.\u201d ",
      "After graduating in 2020, she moved to Nashville, and in 2022, released a debut EP, \u201cPistol Made of Roses,\u201d catching the attention of all-star songwriters who she'd eventually work with on \u201cLucky,\u201d like Lori McKenna, Luke Laird, and Jessie Jo Dillon. The rest is only history because of the strength of her songwriting \u2014 \u201cemo cowgirl\" music, as she calls it. ",
      "That's evidenced throughout \u201cLucky\u201d from the deceptively optimistic \u201cSad Songs for Sad People,\u201d to the Johnny Cash and June Carter-referencing \u201cWhy Johnny\u201d to the opener \u201cI'm Not Pretty,\u201d with its Gen Z Taylor Swift -level acuity: \u201cDid you mean to double-tap that Spring Break throwback from 2016 in PCB?,\u201d she sings on the track, a reference to Southeastern Conference (SEC) college football, social media doom scrolling, the devastation of past relationships and the universal experience of \u201ccreeping or getting creeped on,\u201d as she puts it. ",
      "It's also apparent on the acoustic self-worth ballad, \u201cGirl in the Mirror,\" which follows a simple chord progression and a woman sacrificing her agency in a relationship and learning to reclaim autonomy afterward. \u201cI think \u2018Girl in the Mirror\u2019 has the most important message of all the songs on the record,\u201d she says. ",
      "It's the tear-jerker live, too. \u201cThat's the one where girls are hugging their friends, group crying, like, having a full-on therapy session.\"",
      "All roads lead to the career-making \u201cTennessee Orange,\" where Moroney, a Georgia Bulldog through and through, puts on University of Tennessee colors for a partner. It's a football love song, one about the concessions people make in the name of affection and intimacy \u2014 and the track that fast-tracked Moroney into the country spotlight. ",
      "\u201cIt's, like, not a conventional love song,\u201d she says. \u201cI think people can tell that I don\u2019t write too many of those because I\u2019m just like, not great at it. But it\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not madly in love with you, but I will wear a color for you and a shirt because I care about you.\u2019 I think that was just my cheeky songwriting coming through with that one. But yeah, I definitely don\u2019t belong in Tennessee Orange as a Georgia Bulldog.\u201d",
      "For that reason, she didn't expect \u201cTennessee Orange\u201d to be her breakout hit. \u201cIf I would have thought, like, \u2018what is my breakout moment going to be?\u2019 It wasn\u2019t going to be a song that was recorded, mixed, mastered and turned in in 48 hours,\u201d she says. ",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the thing about putting out music,\" she adds. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to resonate with people.\u201d ",

      "It hardly mattered that \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d was released simultaneously in theaters and on streaming this weekend. Fans flocked to movie theaters across the country to see the scary video game adaptation on the big screen, which made $78 million to top the North American box office, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Universal Pictures bet on a day-and-date release on the weekend before Halloween, sending it to 3,675 theaters in the U.S. and Canada, while also making it available for Peacock subscribers, the subscription streaming service owned by NBCUniversal. The movie also opened in 64 markets internationally, where it\u2019s expected to gross $52.6 million, giving the film a $130.6 million global launch \u2013 the biggest of any horror released this year.",
      "\u201cIt was an extraordinary debut,\u201d said Jim Orr, the president of domestic distribution for Universal, who praised Blumhouse, the filmmakers and the studio's marketing department for the targeted campaign.",
      "\u201cOur marketing department continues to be one of the great superpowers we have at Universal,\" he said.",
      "Blumhouse, the company behind \u201cParanormal Activity,\u201d \u201cGet Out\u201d and recent horror hits like \u201cM3GAN\u201d and \u201cThe Black Phone,\u201d produced \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s,\u201d which was directed by Emma Tammi and stars Josh Hutcherson, Mary Stuart Masterson and Matthew Lillard. The popular video game series, in which a security guard has to fend off murderous animatronic characters at a run down family pizza restaurant, Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza, was created by Scott Cawthon and first released in 2014.",
      "While the game\u2019s fanbase was strong, and passionate, the movie took many years to make. Producer Jason Blum said in an interview with IGN earlier this year that he was made fun of for pursuing an adaptation.",
      "\u201cEveryone said we could never get the movie done, including, by the way, internally in my company,\u201d Blum said. They made the film with a reported $20 million production budget.",
      "And it paid off: \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d is his company\u2019s biggest opening of all time, surpassing \u201cHalloween\u2019s\u201d domestic and global debut. It's also Blumhouse's 19th No. 1 debut, which Orr noted is an \u201camazing accomplishment.\u201d",
      "The opening weekend audience was predominately male (58%) and overwhelmingly young, with an estimated 80% under the age of 25 and 38% between the ages of 13 and 17.",
      "While the numbers aren't surprising for anyone who knows the game's audience, it is still notable for a generation not known for making theatrical moviegoing a priority.",
      "\u201cIt's great to get that kind of audience in theaters,\u201d Orr said. ",
      "Audiences gave the film an A- CinemaScore, which could be promising for future weekends too.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very young demographic,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIt won\u2019t be lost on any of the other studios or video game manufacturers. This door has been kicked wide open.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also notable that so many chose theaters even though it was also available to watch at home. ",
      "\u201cIn some cases streaming can be additive and complimentary to theatrical,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cClearly audiences wanted that communal experience.",
      "\u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d did not score well with critics, however. It currently has a dismal 25% on Rotten Tomatoes. AP\u2019s Mark Kennedy wrote that it \u201chas to go down as one of the poorest films in any genre this year.\u201d But like many other horror movies, it appears to be critic-proof. ",
      "In second place, \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d is expected to cross $200 million in global grosses by the end of Sunday, having added $14.7 million domestically and $6.7 million internationally this weekend. The concert film, distributed by AMC Theatres, is in its third weekend in theaters where it is only playing from Thursday through Sunday, though there will be \u201cspecial Halloween showtimes\u201d on Tuesday at a discounted price of $13.13.",
      "Third place went to Martin Scorsese's \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d which added $9 million in its second weekend, bringing its total domestic earnings to $40.7 million, according to Paramount. With an additional $14.1 million from international showings, the film's global total now stands at over $88 million. ",

      "DENVER -- Colorado lawyers seeking to disqualify former President Donald Trump from running for the White House again argued on Monday that his role in the January 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol runs afoul of the Constitution's insurrection clause, opening a hearing that could break new ground in constitutional law. ",
      "Attorney Eric Olson recounted Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric preceding the Jan. 6 attack and his encouraging a crowd that came within \u201c40 feet\u201d of the vice president when it stormed the Capitol. He said Trump \u201csummoned and organized the mob.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are here because Trump claims, after all that, that he has the right to be president again,\u201d Olson said. \u201cBut our Constitution, the shared charter of our nation, says he cannot do so.\u201d ",
      "Trump\u2019s legal team and presidential campaign assailed the lawsuit as little more than an attempt by Democrats to derail his attempt to reclaim his old job. Trump is so far dominating the Republican presidential primary.",
      "Before the hearing on the lawsuit began, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to have the judge recuse herself because she had donated in the past to a liberal group in the state. She said no. The campaign also noted the current lawsuit was filed by a liberal nonprofit in a state that voted for Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.",
      "\u201cThey send money to these dark money groups \u2014 they go to a Democratic jurisdiction and a Democratic judge,\u201d Trump spokesman Jason Miller said.",
      "Monday\u2019s hearing in Colorado state court is in the first of two lawsuits that could end up reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. On Thursday, the Minnesota Supreme Court hears oral arguments in a similar case.",
      "Ultimately, either the Colorado or Minnesota case is expected to land at the U.S. Supreme Court, which has never ruled on the Civil War-era provision.

      "Former Capitol Police Officer Winston Pingeon testified about several hours of what he called \u201chand-to-hand combat\u201d with Trump supporters storming the Capitol. The plaintiffs' lawyers played several videos capturing the day's violence, as well as a montage of Trump tweets and statements falsely blaming election fraud for his 2020 loss, culminating in his heated speech to the crowd on Jan. 6.",
      "The case will pivot on whether the Jan. 6 attack meets the meaning of \u201cinsurrection\" in the 14th Amendment. It will also hinge on whether Trump's action meets the definition of \u201cengaging\u201d and whether the rarely used provision was meant to apply to the presidency.",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers contend the former president was simply exercising his free speech rights to warn about election results he did not believe were legitimate.

      "His lawyers said none of the issues are simple in a provision of the Constitution that hasn\u2019t been used in 150 years.

      "Rich Eisen has had many memorable moments during his long tenure at NFL Network. This weekend though might end up being tough to beat.",
      "Saturday marks 20 years since NFL Network went on the air with Eisen anchoring \u201cTotal Access.\u201d On Sunday, Eisen will call one of the biggest games of the first nine weeks when the Kansas City Chiefs face the Miami Dolphins in Frankfurt, Germany.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that 20 years ago was the beginning of the advent of of a network that changed the lives of so many fans. I truly believe that,\u201d Eisen said. \u201cAnd then a day later is one of the biggest games we've ever had, which is obviously what all of us dreamed about that this network would be when we started it.\u201d",
      "And Eisen has been there every step of the way. Much like Chris Berman and Bob Ley can discuss the evolution of ESPN, Eisen can do the same thing with NFL Network as he was the first on-air host to be hired.",
      "NFL Network wasn't the first league-run channel to go on the air \u2014 that honor goes to NBA TV in 1999 \u2014 but it has been a driver in the league becoming year-around viewing as well as providing a template for making routine events into must watch.",
      "Due to NFL Network, the schedule release has gone from a random news release drop in early April, to a two-hour, prime-time special in early May broadcast on multiple networks. ",
      "Coverage of the Senior Bowl and Scouting Combine has led to the draft process being its own season full of debates from fans on who their teams should select. The draft itself has gone from a weekend event in New York to a three-day traveling road show, with the first two days in prime time, that is carried on multiple networks.",
      "It also made a small package of Thursday night games that started in 2006 into a season-long package that Amazon Prime Video pays over $1 billion per season to carry.",
      "\u201cThese are all things that I am proud to have been a part of and watch develop based on the maturation of NFL Network. It has grown into a heck of a lot more that is a major source of pride,\u201d Eisen said.",
      "When asked to look back at the start of NFL Network, Eisen said the lead up made him \u201cnervouscited,\u201d which was a mixture of nervous and excited. However, it wasn't until the Super Bowl in Houston three months later that he was confident he made the right decision leaving ESPN.",
      "\u201cThere were a ton of moving parts for me. I left ESPN and I had got married in June (2003). I remember walking down the hallway at the Convention Center and I got emotional because I knew it was going to be big and everything was going to be cool,\u201d he said.",
      "Bob Thompson, the former president of Fox Sports Networks and co-founder of the Big Ten Network, said the start of NFL Network gave the league a year-around presence but more importantly gave value to Thursday nights.",
      "\u201cThey showed that people would watch games outside of Sunday and Monday. I think it also gave everybody else a sense of comfort that the chances of success (for starting their own networks) were pretty good,\u201d he said.",
      "The Big Ten and NHL networks started in 2007 and MLB Network went on the air in 2009. It also led to the start of networks by the Pac- 12 (2012), SEC (2014) and ACC (2019).",
      "According to Nielsen, NFL Network is distributed in 51.1 million homes. That's a decline from the 72.5 million homes it was in 10 years ago as more people move away from cable and satellite. NFL Network though was made available direct to consumer over the summer for those who purchase the NFL+ streaming service.",
      "Sunday\u2019s game in Germany will be the biggest on NFL Network since 2007, when the New England Patriots went for an undefeated regular season against the New York Giants. That game was simulcast on NBC and CBS while the Chiefs-Dolphins game will only be on NFL Network and local channels in Miami and Kansas City.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty sweet to witness an international crowd, but I think the folks in Germany truly get the sport. They were exposed to it significantly in (the former) World League,\u201d Eisen said. \u201cIt is the Chiefs, and Patrick Mahomes is coming to town along with a high-flying Miami Dolphins team with Tyreek Hill facing his former teammates. It truly touches on every aspect of storylines. There's also no question Taylor Swift has made the Chiefs much more of an international commodity than the actual Super Bowl. I couldn\u2019t be more excited that it coincides with the network anniversary.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- With new categories, SZA, and \u201cBarbie\u201d \u2014 there's a lot to discuss regarding the 2024 Grammy Award nominations. Who didn't make the cut? What were the best surprises of all? Let's take a look.",
      "There's a lot to love about the nominations for the 66th Grammy Awards \u2014 and quite a bit to be a little confused by. Rene\u00e9 Rapp, Peso Pluma and PinkPantheress are absent from the best new artist category despite having remarkable years. Rapp's \u201cSnow Angel\u201d was the biggest debut solo album from a female artist this year.",
      "Rapp and PinkPantheress were both shut out and Peso Pluma only picked up one nomination: best m\u00fasica Mexicana album (including Tejano) for his third studio album, \u201cG\u00e9nesis.\u201d",
      "In fact, in a year dominated by m\u00fasica Mexicana, it is surprising to see no nods for Eslabon Armado or Grupo Frontera, particularly for their songs \u201cElla Baila Sola\u201d with Peso Pluma and \u201cUn x100to\" with Bad Bunny, respectively. Natanael Cano and Fuerza Regida are also noticeably absent. ",
      "This year, there are only three nominees for best m\u00fasica urbana album \u2014 because the category received fewer than 40 entries \u2014 and accounts for Karol G's sole nomination, for her historic 2023 album \u201cMa\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito.\u201d",
      "Undeniably, country music has had a massive 2023. In July, country acts held the top three spots on the Hot 100 for the first time: Controversy hoisted Jason Aldean's \u201cTry That In a Small Town\u201d to No. 1, followed by Morgan Wallen's \u201cLast Night\u201d and Luke Combs' cover of Tracy Chapman's \u201cFast Car.\u201d ",
      "Also, over the summer, country singer Oliver Anthony Music's became the first artist to debut on the Hot 100 at the top of it, with the viral \u201cRich Men North of Richmond.\" Aldean and Anthony's dominance wasn't long \u2014 and Combs did earn a 2024 Grammy nomination for best country solo performance \u2014 but Wallen stands out as an obvious exclusion. ",
      "While \u201cLast Night\u201d is nominated for best country song, a songwriter's award, Wallen himself isn't despite his successful year. His latest album, \u201cOne Thing at a Time,\u201d had, as of Oct. 14, spent 16 weeks at the top \u2014 which meant he's held the top spot for nearly 40% of the year so far ... and his record was released in March. ",
      "This isn't the first time Wallen has been absent from nominations. In 2021, after video surfaced of him using a racial slur, he was disqualified or limited from several award shows and received no Grammy nominations for his bestselling \u201cDangerous: The Double Album.\u201d",
      "The eligibility window ran from Oct. 1, 2022, through Sept. 15, 2023, which means quite a few K-pop heavyweights could have been nominated: TOMORROW X TOGETHER, Stray Kids and the Y2K-loving girl group NewJeans. But they weren't.",
      "All three had releases hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 \u2014 TXT's \u201cThe Name Chapter: Temptation\u201d in February, Stray Kids' \u201cMaxident\u201d and NewJeans' \u201cGet Up.\u201d",
      "Some critics had theorized that NewJeans might earn a best new artist nomination, which would have made them the first ever K-pop girl group to receive a Grammy nod. It could've been them, or the K-pop girl group Fifty Fifty, whose bubblegum pop single \u201cCupid\u201d was inescapable on TikTok this summer \u2014 they became so ubiquitous, they even appeared on the \u201cBarbie\u201d film soundtrack. ",
      "Yet, after Friday's announcement, BTS remains the only K-pop group to ever receive a Grammy nod. And despite five nominations, they have no Grammy wins.",
      "Much to the chagrin of fans of Michelle Williams\u2019 reading of Britney Spears\u2019 memoir \u201cThe Woman in Me,\u201d the actor will not be eligible in the best audio book, narration & storytelling recording category this cycle. That's a 2025 possibility. ",
      "But perhaps most shocking of all is the omission of Prince Harry, whose memoir \u201cSpare\u201d sold more than 3.2 million copies worldwide in just one week. The British royal narrated the audiobook but did not receive a nomination. Instead, Meryl Streep, William Shatner, Rick Rubin, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Michelle Obama did.",
      "Using charts as the most immediate metric of popularity: There's been a bit of a dearth of dominant hip-hop releases. It's a shocking shift, as the Luminate 2022 Year-End report found that R&B/hip-hop is America\u2019s most popular genre, accounting for the most U.S. on-demand song streams and the largest share of total album consumption. In fact, no rapper was able to top the Billboard 200 until Travis Scott's \u201cUtopia\" dropped in August. This time around, Scott only picked up one nomination: best rap album.",
      "Curiously missing from the list is Gunna, whose 2023 album \u201cA Gift & a Curse\" was massive. It is clear that some of the biggest hits in the genre were pushed to rap-specific categories (think Lil Durk ft. J. Cole\u2019s \u201cAll My Life,\u201d or Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s \u201cJust Wanna Rock.\u201d)",
      "If there is something to pop bottles over, it's Victoria Mon\u00e9t's seven nominations. The R&B singer-songwriter is no stranger to Grammy nominations \u2014 but for a different skillset. Mon\u00e9t was nominated as a producer for album of the year at the 2020 Grammys, for her work on Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cThank U, Next.\u201d At the time, she was best known as hit maker for Grande and Chloe x Halle, though she\u2019s always been one to watch as a soloist. ",
      "This time around, she\u2019s the only leading nominee also up for best new artist. Mon\u00e9t has also picked up record of the year and best R&B song nominations for her glossy, brassy \u201cOn My Mama,\u201d best R&B performance and best traditional R&B performance. Her 2023 release, \u201cJaguar ll,\u201d is up for best R&B album and best engineered album, non-classical. ",
      "The best story of the 2024 Grammy nominations, of course, is just how many women are represented in the major categories. ",
      "The majority of leading nominees are women and include superstars like Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Miley Cyrus and Olivia Rodrigo. In both the record and album of the year categories, the only man represented is Jon Batiste.",

      "How about mundane, schlubby, average? Not the page we\u2019d think to turn to in our Roget\u2019s Thesaurus.",
      "Yet here Cage is, channeling his inner drabness to chillingly comic effect in Kristoffer Borgli\u2019s \u201cDream Scenario.\u201d As Paul Matthews (heck, even the name is drab), a college professor at nowhere famous, he performs his job with perfect mediocrity, and seems a fairly mediocre husband and dad, too. With his graying beard, wire-rimmed specs and shiny bald spot, Cage\u2019s Paul is the guy in the room you ignore.",
      "Until, suddenly, you can't. Because something weird starts happening. Paul starts appearing in people\u2019s dreams. Everyone\u2019s dreams.",
      "The premise is delicious \u2014 and precarious. It recalled for me the setup in a very different movie, \u201cYesterday,\u201d where only one guy on Earth remembers the Beatles. It makes for a fantastic beginning, but you immediately worry how they\u2019ll manage to keep it going.",
      "But Borgli, the Norwegian writer-director making his English-language debut here (Ari Aster co-produces), is aiming for a broader statement about the nature of fame. And while the topic, which he's broached before, may not be original, it's ripe for exploration in the right hands \u2014 especially with an actor as inventive and unpredictable as Cage. Fame can be intoxicating, this film is saying, but it can and probably will turn on you in an instant, unless you\u2019re Taylor Swift (OK, we added that last part).",
      "We begin on an autumn day by a suburban swimming pool, where Paul is raking leaves near his teen daughter. Scary things start dropping from the heavens, and suddenly the girl is grabbed by an unknown force and lifted, screaming, into the sky. Dad? He does nothing to help.",
      "It\u2019s only the girl\u2019s dream. But then there are more. Paul and his patient wife, Janet (Julianne Nicholson, reliably excellent) run into someone at the theater, and she too has dreamed about Paul. At a dinner party, several guests discover to their shock that they\u2019ve been dreaming about the same person. Yep, Paul.",
      "What's happening? On campus, Paul\u2019s students, who mostly chat among themselves during his unremarkable lectures on evolutionary biology, start listening \u2014 they\u2019re dreaming about him, too.",
      "In many of these dreams, Paul stands by, inexplicably, as others experience peril \u2014 slithering alligators, for example. But in real life, for once, Paul has the floor \u2014 a man who until now seethed with frustration over his unrealized ambitions as others succeeded. Now, everyone is interested in him.",
      "Borgli never stops to analyze the science of this bizarre development, and frankly, Paul doesn\u2019t either. He takes a meeting with a snarky group of branding experts (led by Michael Cera, perfectly cast) who want to market him up the wazoo. They can get him a Sprite commercial! Well, Paul doesn't want that \u2014 he just wants a book deal for his biology research. But his ears perk up at the idea of an endorsement from Barack Obama. (\u201cI know Malia,\u201d one of these young professionals says.)",
      "One young woman even lets on to Paul that in her dreams, the two have great sex. This is too stunning for the schlubby Paul to ignore, especially when she invites him home to recreate the dream. Needless to say, it doesn\u2019t go as well in real life. In fact, the d\u00e9noument is utterly, agonizingly humiliating.",
      "And then, everyone's dreams change. Suddenly Paul is the one causing harm. His students, terrified, don\u2019t want to see him anymore. He gets sent home from a dinner with friends. He can\u2019t even sit in a coffee shop and read a book without a fellow diner spitting on his food.",
      "As for the branding consultants, well, they inform Paul that Obama is off the table \u2014 but hey, they could get him time with Joe Rogan or maybe Tucker Carlson.",
      "We won\u2019t spoil the ending, but let\u2019s just make the obvious point that Borgli is not making a rom-com \u2014 is there a word for \u201chorror-com\u201d? We walk away from this funny, sad, scary film acutely reminded that if fame has two sides, one of them is pretty darned horrible.",

      "Strong spending by consumers has been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession, and Vivid Seats CEO Stan Chia doesn't see demand in his industry falling off",
      "NEW YORK -- Strong spending by consumers has been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession, and Vivid Seats CEO Stan Chia doesn\u2019t see demand in his industry falling off. ",
      "He says customers are still using Vivid Seats to find tickets to concerts, sporting events and the theater even if interest rates are high and sentiment surveys show shoppers say they\u2019re feeling nervous. Vivid Seats' marketplace allows people to buy and sell their tickets to live events. ",
      "Chia told The Associated Press that he believes the explosion of pent-up demand for entertainment outside the house following the pandemic has burned out, and trends have returned more to normal. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: I think what we can certainly see in our category is live events continues to be one that consumers are prioritizing in their discretionary income. ",
      "This category, while it is discretionary by definition, doesn\u2019t behave like others, like buying a new TV. You don\u2019t really think about buying a new TV in the same way as whether you\u2019re going to a Guns N' Roses concert.",
      "We are now past any point of potential pent-up demand release. What we\u2019re really into is secular trends of the industry that really drive it forward. I think about where the generational priority is on spending. If you think about Gen Z, as they come into purchasing power they have prioritized experiences over goods and services. ",
      "You\u2019ve got folks like myself \u2014 the Guns N' Roses references shows I'm a geriatric millennial \u2014 I\u2019ve certainly got a little more money than I did 20 years ago, and the bands that I love are touring, and I love the opportunity to go see that.",
      "A: Where we fit as marketplace for live events, we are a great barometer for how much demand exceeds supply. ",
      "If you go back to maybe 2021, the second half of that year through the first half of 2022, you could look at where our average order size was relative to 2019, for example, and you saw really, really big jumps. That\u2019s where you saw pent-up demand being released. Numerically, just fantastic growth of that magnitude, that\u2019s clearly driven by pent-up demand",
      "In the second half of 2022 and now in 2023, if you were to plot that line, we\u2019re right back on the industry line. The consumer demand is past pent-up demand.",
      "A: I certainly read and see all the things out there about the strength of the consumer and where sentiment is, but in this category, we\u2019ve continued to see strength. ",
      "We\u2019re headquartered in Chicago Illinois, and the example I like to give, which unfortunately is not going to be true this year, is if the Bears go to the Super Bowl, you\u2019re going to see a lot of fans who want to go to that event. This category in particular has that FOMO-esque truth to it. That\u2019s what continues to drive consumer purchasing.",
      "A: I think fandom just traverses all categories and all demographics. You\u2019ve got a very consistent level of intensity whether you\u2019re talking about sports fans, concert fans, theater fans, comedy fans, down to the team level. ",
      "A: Taylor Swift and Beyonce are phenomenal artists and performers. We\u2019re just so privileged to see them put on amazing shows this year. I think the beauty of the category is there are always amazing artists out there on tour. We\u2019re in the fourth quarter of the year now, we\u2019re excited to hear about the major acts that are going to be playing next year. We just heard Foo Fighters are going on tour next summer.",
      "A: No. Until we become a household name, and we are on our way there, you\u2019re always going to look and see who is this company. You'll find we are an award-winning customer service company with a 100% buyer guarantee and a rewards program.",
      "A: We are so supportive of all efforts and all legislation that drive transparency in all industries. We\u2019re going to continue to be very supportive of a competitive playing field. ",
      "We understand that consumers are looking for value in what they purchase, and I think when you look at what we do \u2013 where customers who buy 10 tickets get one (more through a reward credit) \u2014 we put our money where the mouth is. ",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really cool just to be on this stage, the world stage, in Germany,\u201d the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback said Friday. \u201cI\u2019m excited to be able to play out here.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs are excited, too, because the game against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday at Deutsche Bank Park is a big step for an organization with global ambitions to become the \u201cworld's team.\u201d",
      "The blueprint is simple enough. They have won two of the past four Super Bowls, they have dynamic stars in reigning MVP Mahomes and All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce, and the NFL has prioritized international growth. Taylor Swift just adds to their good timing.",
      "\u201cWe feel like this is our era,\u201d Chiefs president Mark Donovan said. \u201cBased on the timing, the success and the stars, it\u2019s a responsibility to take advantage of this. If we don\u2019t aggressively take advantage of this, that\u2019s a failure.\"",
      "The Chiefs have commercial rights in Germany under the league\u2019s global markets program, meaning they can sign corporate sponsorship deals, hold events to attract fans and sell merchandise as they do in their home markets. That country list includes Austria and Switzerland, as well as Mexico.",
      "The NFL added a 17th game to the schedule to facilitate playing more games abroad, and it is reviewing Spain and Brazil as future hosts, one of them possibly for the 2024 season.",
      "\u201cIt can be looked at as maybe arrogant. I like to look at it as ambitious, but we want to be the world\u2019s team,\" Donovan said. \"We think the opportunity exists today for us to set a foothold that we are the world\u2019s team, that people look at the Chiefs as an international representation of the NFL.\u201d",
      "They say they have some numbers to back it up, too. The NFL told the Chiefs that they are No. 2 in \u201crevenue generated from the international markets,\u201d Donovan said. He declined to say which team is first, and the NFL didn't comment.",
      "The Chiefs have played two other regular-season international games, winning in Mexico City in 2019 and in London four years earlier.",
      "This one is different, though. The global markets program only took effect in January 2022, the Chiefs have another Lombardi Trophy, and Mahomes is increasingly the face of the league following the retirement of Tom Brady.",
      "\u201cFrom our standpoint, we\u2019re going to be aggressive in looking at additional markets, and we\u2019re going to be aggressive in looking at additional games,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cWe think games are the best way to have that foothold activation.\u201d",
      "With the league studying Spain and Brazil, those two countries are atop Kansas City's list of potential next markets, Donovan said.",
      "The Chiefs are \u201ctalking to the league\u201d about ways to play more international games. As is, they are a big draw around the U.S., so other teams don't want to give up the revenue that comes with a visit from Chiefs Kingdom. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, for example, rejected the Chiefs as the \u201caway\u201d team for their game in Munich last season, Donovan said.",
      "Kansas City is the designated \u201chome\u201d team in Frankfurt, as will be the New England Patriots next week against the Indianapolis Colts.",
      "The Chiefs have spent about $1 million in preparation and fan events for Frankfurt \u2014 that includes docking a Chiefs-themed yacht in the Main River. Over the past nearly three years, the team has spent about $3 million on its international efforts, with the majority invested in Germany, Donovan said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to pay off over time,\u201d he said.",
      "The late Lamar Hunt was an early proponent of going international. The Chiefs have played preseason games in Japan, Mexico and Germany.",
      "A memorable preseason game took place in August 1990 when the Chiefs played the Los Angeles Rams at Olympic Stadium in West Berlin after the Berlin Wall fell and just before reunification. Media reports said there were 55,000 fans.",
      "Growing an international fan base these days \u201cis much easier to do now because of social media, because of the digital delivery of games,\" Chiefs Chairman and CEO Clark Hunt said this week.",
      "As for becoming the world's team, Donovan acknowledges it won't be easy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big, audacious goal,\u201d he said. ",

      "Let's talk about Alvin Kamara.",
      "Your inclination might be to sell high on Kamara. After all, he's averaging 21.7 fantasy points per week in PPR leagues his four games since returning from suspension, topped only at running back by the injured De'Von Achane (25.4 PPG) and the unstoppable Christian McCaffrey (24.4 PPG).",
      "This may not feel sustainable to you. Some of his numbers are downright silly.",
      "Since returning, Alvin Kamara is first in targets (39) and receptions (35) for RBs (a 149 reception pace!)<br><br>And, those rank sixth and second OVERALL (only Kelce has more receptions in that span)",
      "Alvin Kamara has averaged 9.8 targets per contest over his four games this year. He's hit a 28% target share in two of those four games.",
      "Frankly, the receptions numbers probably aren't going to last, at least at his current pace. But it's very possible that dumping the ball off to Kamara is going to remain a very, very important aspect of the New Orleans' offense given Derek Carr's limitations as a quarterback.",
      "Three of the biggest FF values - Alvin Kamara, Jakobi Meyers, and Adam Thielen - are hitting bc their hot zones coincide with limitations of passing games/QBs - something to keep in mind in draft prep: Identifying inefficient pass Os can matter as much identifying efficient ones",
      "Having Alvin Kamara (known for his impact as a receiver) as the RB for a Derek Carr (addicted to checkdowns) offense is like dropping a pack of cigs off on a smoker's bedside table every morning. <br><br>Even if he wanted to quit, he has no shot. It's over as soon as the day begins. <a href=\"https://t.co/WYRvP49I8m\">https://t.co/WYRvP49I8m</a>",
      "But here's another thing to consider\u2014through four games, Kamara only has one touchdown. That's just 0.25 touchdowns per game. For his career, however, Kamara averages 0.78 touchdowns each contest.",
      "Now, past performance is no guarantee of future production. But Kamara is clearly the featured back in New Orleans' offense and has proven to be a dynamic enough playmaker during his career that you would expect him to find the end zone with more regularity.",
      "Which means that while some of his gaudy receptions numbers are likely to dwindle a bit, he very easily could replace that production with a bit more touchdown output.",
      "Granted, some of those touches could go to Jamaal Williams near the goal line. The pair has only played in one game together. But Kamara is going to see far more touches in general, giving him more opportunities to break off a score.",
      "You may be reading this wondering why we're going into so much depth discussing a player you probably shouldn't be selling on. Kamara is a RB1 the rest of the way, and even though his trade value is incredibly high right now, there's too much unpredictability at running back to just give a player like him away, even if the return is high.",
      "The idea here is to give you a deeper look into the thought process you should be undertaking each time you consider selling high or buying low.",
      "Let's do it again, this time with Jakobi Meyers, another player that feels like he should be a sell-high candidate.",
      "Meyers is lower on the fantasy rankings than teammate Davante Adams due to missing a game, but he's actually averaging more fantasy points per week (17.6) than his superstar counterpart (16.7).",
      "Jakobi Meyers Last 3 Games:<br><br>Week 5: WR10<br>Week 6: WR14<br>Week 7: WR11<br><br>One of the biggest steals in Fantasy this year",
      "But while Kamara's production has been non-reliant on touchdown production, a solid chunk of Meyers' fantasy output has come from his five touchdowns in six games. That has represented 28.4 percent of his total fantasy points on the season.",
      "Compare that to Adams, who has recorded three touchdowns, just 15.4 percent of his fantasy points scored on the season. Generally speaking, it's easier to trust the wideout who is getting a higher percentage of his fantasy value from yards and receptions than touchdowns.",
      "But... it gets more interesting as you dig further.",
      "Adams is putting up 6.5 receptions per game played, compared to 6.1 for Meyers. That's extremely close. Adams is being targeted 10.1 times per game, compared to 9.3 for Meyers. Again, very tight. And Adams is registering 75.4 receiving yards per game, compared to 64.1 for Meyers.",
      "This is not the case of Adams being far-and-away the most highly-prioritized receiver in the pecking order. Meyers is getting a lot of targets and receptions. A slower touchdown rate would take him out of the realm of low-end WR1 production, yes, but it might not drop him below the realm of WR2 output.",
      "The major difference between he and Kamara is that the New Orleans' running back should  be the focal point of the team's offense, given his playmaking ability, whereas in Las Vegas the two players who should receive the biggest serving of usage are Adams and running back Josh Jacobs.",
      "That's what makes Meyers a better sell-high option than Kamara. It's a risk, no doubt, given how productive he's been. But conventional logic would dictate that at least a small downturn in production is coming at some point.",
      "He's probably locked in place as a very nice flex option for the rest of the year. He just doesn't seem likely to put up WR1 numbers the entire way, and if you can get those type of prices in a trade, take them."

      "Justin Jefferson probably isn't going to suit up this week after being taken off injured reserve, but his pending return will diminish Jordan Addison's fantasy upside, making the latter a sell-high candidate (although you could choose to wait a week before dealing him).",

      "In the first four weeks, Addison was targeted 20 times. In the last four games, he's been targeted 30 times.",
      "Now, to be fair, there's a little bit of noise in these numbers, as Addison was held without a catch in Week 4 and was only targeted once.

      "Cole Kmet has enjoyed life with Tyson Bagent under center, pulling down 16 receptions for 134 yards and two touchdowns in the past two weeks. It's been a little hit or miss, of course, as he wasn't targeted once in Bagent's first start back in Week 7.",
      "But still, he's averaging 13.8 fantasy points per week in Bagent's three starts compared to 11.1 points per game in Fields' six starts. Kmet has been a bit feast-or-famine enough under both quarterbacks to not go too wild in sell-high mode on him, but it's worth considering if Fields' clear connection with D.J. Moore might eat a bit into Kmet's targets upon his eventual return.",
      "Under Bagent, Kmet has been targeted eight or more times in two straight games. Under Fields, he only exceeded eight targets once.",
      "Moore, meanwhile, gets an enormous boost once Fields return. In three games under Bagent he's averaging 9.4 fantasy points per week. In the first six games of the year, he was putting up a gaudy 20 fantasy points per contest.",

      "Sell High: Jahmyr Gibbs",
      "Look, Gibbs is awesome. In the last two games he's rushed for 220 yards and two touchdowns and caught 14 passes for 95 yards. Those are epic numbers, and he's absolutely earned more snaps and touches.",
      "But David Montgomery is going to return to the fold at some point, likely after the Week 9 bye, and we saw how he dominated the touches when both he and Gibbs were healthy.",
      "In the three games both players suited up together, Montgomery had 69 carries for 262 yards and five scores, adding three receptions for 27 yards. Gibbs, meanwhile, had 22 carries for 99 yards, adding 13 catches for 68 yards. He didn't have a touchdown.",
      "Chances are, Montgomery's return isn't going to be great for Gibbs' fantasy value based on those usage numbers, even if Gibbs has earned a larger role going forward. He'll still be in a platoon when Montgomery returns, so now is a great chance to sell high to the player in your league desperate for an upgrade at running back.",
      "Buy Low: Jordan Addison",
      "Yes, you read that right. Despite Kirk Cousins being done for the season, Minnesota added Joshua Dobbs, a player who is far more serviceable than Jaren Hall at quarterback.",
      "Fantasy players are going to be inclined to sell on Addison, thinking they'll be doing so at the peak of his fantasy value with Cousins done for the season.",
      "Driving home I got the alert about Josh Dobbs being traded to Minnesota. So I pulled over of course. This is GREAT news for TJ Hockenson, Jordan Addison, Justin Jefferson and Josh Dobbs himself. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rotoworld_fb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@rotoworld_fb</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/fantasyfootball?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#fantasyfootball</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vikings?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#vikings</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/joshdobbs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#joshdobbs</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/skol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#skol</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/W0TNwTizmM\">pic.twitter.com/W0TNwTizmM</a>",
      "But slow your roll. With Dobbs as the quarterback in Arizona, Marquise Brown had five weeks of double-digit points in PPR leagues, while Michael Wilson had two. Dobbs didn't incinerate the value of Brown, and he shouldn't do so with Addison either.",
      "Sure, there's a chance Addison sees a slight decrease in production without Cousins (or once Justin Jefferson returns). But you might also be able to get him for fairly cheap right now. Don't be afraid to pull the trigger on such a trade\u2014he'll still be a very nice option.",
      "Buy Low: Davante Adams",
      "The regime change in Las Vegas is good for Adams. So is going from Jimmy Garoppolo to Aidan O'Connell.",
      "Davante Adams' fantasy splits since Week 4:<br><br>with Jimmy Garoppolo: 4 fantasy PPG<br>with Aidan O'Connell: 10.35 fantasy PPG",

Think that'd happen later on.",
      "There's not much more to say than that. Expect the new coaching staff under Antonio Pierce and O'Connell to make a real effort to build the offense around Adams, as it always should have been. Get in on the ground floor of this.",

      "Add in the injury suffered a week ago by Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson, and the top two picks in many fantasy drafts this summer could be out in Week 7. So could multiple starting quarterbacks, which impacts not just them but also the players around them.",
      "Oh, and a full half-dozen teams are on bye this week\u2014because of course they are.",

      "Cleveland's Deshaun Watson (shoulder) and Daniel Jones of the New York Giants (neck) were already out in Week 6. Justin Fields of the Chicago Bears suffered a dislocated thumb against the Minnesota Vikings. Trevor Lawrence of the Jaguars injured his leg late in Jacksonville's win over the Indianapolis Colts. Jimmy Garoppolo of the Las Vegas Raiders landed in the hospital briefly with a back injury.",

      "Geno Smith, Seattle Seahawks (vs. AZ) [DraftKings DFS Value: $6,000]",
      "Like Love, Smith's last start was an ugly one\u2014he tossed a pair of interceptions in last Sunday's loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. But the Cardinals present an excellent chance for a bounce-back\u2014the Redbirds rank among the top-five teams in the NFL in fantasy points per game allowed to quarterbacks.",
      "BAD MATCHUPS",
      "Jared Goff, Detroit Lions (at BAL) [DraftKings DFS Value: 6,400]",
      "Goff has been solid both for the Lions and fantasy managers this season, ranking among the top-five quarterbacks in fantasy points after six weeks. But this week's matchup is a tough one\u2014Baltimore is a top-three pass defense and bottom-three fantasy matchup for quarterbacks.",
      "Russell Wilson, Denver Broncos (vs. GB) [DraftKings DFS Value: $5,400]",
      "Wilson's last outing was a dismal performance\u2014he threw for fewer than 100 yards and was picked off twice against the Kansas City Chiefs. Fantasy managers looking for a fill-in starter in Week 7 should look elsewhere\u2014the Packers are ninth in the NFL in pass defense.",
      "SLEEPER",
      "Tyrod Taylor, New York Giants (vs. WAS) [DraftKings DFS Value: $5,100]",
      "A pretty compelling argument can be made that Taylor played as well Sunday night against the Buffalo Bills as Daniel Jones has all season. Now he draws a 27th-ranked Washington pass defense that ranks toward the top of the league in fantasy points surrendered to the quarterback position.",

He gets a great matchup this week, facing a Green Bay defense giving up 22.5 fantasy points to opposing backs per week, sixth worst in the NFL.",
      "The Packers have allowed five rushers to go for double-digit fantasy points against them. And Matt Stafford might not be playing, which could lead to a heavy dosage of run calls. Get Henderson in those lineups.",

      "Merzlikins opted for a more low-key iteration of the Joker this year, exchanging the green undershirt for a green tie, adding some stupendous kicks, and it all comes together for a look that is not at all costume-y. It's like if the Joker had street style. I love this subtle, continued tribute to Kivlenieks. Those we've lost stay with us in the day-to-day, in the quiet moments we think of them, in something sustainable that can last year after year. Merzlikins' fit does exactly this.",
      "I've seen several iterations of the NHL Style Rankings popping up recently (that many of you have tagged me in, and trust me, I appreciate the loyalty to what we're doing here at Bleacher Report more than you know). The Merzlikins of the world are why I say the more, the merrier.",
      "The comment sections, of course, are full of the predictable \"Who cares?\" \"Canceling my subscription,\" \"File this next to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce,\" stuff. Rinse and repeat.",
      "I pity these commenters, who clearly don't understand and/or appreciate the whole point of fashion and personal style. Fashion gives you the ability to express yourself without having to say a word, and this gives us as good a window into NHL players' personalities as anything in this \"we before I\" league.",
      "Whether it's expression of a new swagger, like Larkin finally getting a decent winger (just kidding), something we can depend on like Newhook and his hats, a keen eye passed down between a father and a son like Josh Morrissey creating and auctioning off a suit as a tribute to his fashion-forward dad, or Merzlikins keeping Kivlenieks' spirit alive in new ways each year, hockey needs fashion. Hockey needs Merzlikins, Laine, Pastrnak, and each and every person who celebrates them."

      "The Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp owner has lost a cumulative $47 billion in its Reality Labs division since the start of 2019, an Insider analysis of regulatory filings found. The segment's operating loss has ballooned from below $5 billion in 2019 to over $10 billion in 2021, nearly $14 billion in 2022, and north of $11 billion in the first nine months of this year.",
      "Zuckerberg and his team fully anticipate that trend will continue. \"We expect our RL operating losses to increase meaningfully in 2024,\" they noted in Meta's third-quarter earnings. \"Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products for the metaverse that may only be fully realized in the next decade.\"",
      "Meta's metaverse losses to date exceed the market capitalization of Ford ($45 billion), Keurig Dr. Pepper ($41 billion), Hershey ($39 billion), Kraft Heinz ($39 billion), and many other large companies. They could soon overtake Lululemon ($49 billion), Chipotle ($50 billion), Target ($51 billion), and Monster Beverage ($52 billion) in size.",
      "If Meta's $47 billion figure was an individual's net worth, they would rank in the top 25 spots on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, ahead of Nike cofounder Phil Knight and his family ($39 billion), Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($36 billion), and Citadel CEO Ken Griffin ($35 billion). They would also be worth nearly half as much as Zuckerberg ($105 billion).",
      "It's worth underscoring that the metaverse business is still a small part of Meta as a whole. Zuckerberg's company raked in $94 billion of revenue and $42 billion of operating profit from its main \"Family of Apps\" division in the nine months to September, compared to less than $1 billion of revenue and a $11.5 billion loss in the RL business. As a result, Meta still generated over $30 billion in total operating income in the period.",

      "In today's big story, we're taking a deeper look at the number of partner departures at Goldman Sachs under CEO David Solomon.",
      "What's on deck:\u00a0",
      "But first, how many people have left?",
      "At least 210 Goldman Sachs partners have left on David Solomon's watch.",
      "Insider came to that number after an exhaustive search of regulatory filings, media reports, and conversations with sources by Dakin Campbell, Emmalyse Brownstein, Walt Hickey, and Kaja Whitehouse.\u00a0",
      "When broken down by year, that amounts to an average annual departure rate of 43.4, per our calculations, slightly above Goldman's projections of 30 to 40 annual partner exits. It's also higher than Insider's analysis of yearly partner exits during the 14 years before Solomon took over as CEO, which came to 40.4.\u00a0",
      "Tracking the departure rate of Goldman's top executives was done to understand the reality \u2014 or myth \u2014 behind the much-discussed concept of a partner exodus under Solomon.",
      "You can view all 210 names here, along with an analysis of the years they left and what division they were in.\u00a0",
      "Goldman, for what it's worth, wasn't a fan of our work, suggesting there are a \"number of discrepancies\" in our \"back-of-the-napkin math,\" per bank spokesperson Tony Fratto.",
      "As is always the case with data, there are a few ways to interpret partner departures under Solomon.",
      "While partner departures under Solomon have increased, according to our analysis, it hasn't been a massive bump. The average annual departure rate is up less than 7% during his tenure, per our calculations. And when you factor in how bloated the partnership got under former CEO Lloyd Blankfein \u2014 hitting 472 at one point \u2014 it's fair to say some trimming was due.\u00a0",
      "The highest number of departures also came during Solomon's first year in charge, which seems normal. New leadership typically leads to more churn as the new boss gets their house in order.",
      "It's also important to remember Solomon isn't beholden to partners. As valuable as these executives are, it's not pre-1999 anymore when partners funded the business. Goldman's shareholders \u2014 not its partners \u2014 are the people Solomon has to answer to at the end of the day.",
      "With that being said, the partner exits aren't all easily explained. The departure of newly minted execs \u2014 at least two who were named partner in 2022 are already gone \u2014 seems particularly troubling.\u00a0",
      "Goldman also likes to pitch departing partners as an extension of the firm. Former Goldman partners become future Goldman clients, the bank likes to say.\u00a0",
      "And while that sounds great on paper \u2014 and is often the case \u2014 it doesn't always work like that. Consider Omer Ismail, who departed Goldman after being tapped to head its entire consumer business to lead a Walmart-backed fintech and took some top executives with him.",

      "She started selling print-on-demand goods in 2021 while working full-time as an MRI tech at a hospital, and also putting in 15 to 30 hours per week to get her shop off the ground. Within one year, she says she generated six figures in revenue and had to reduce her hours at the hospital. The catch? She's still working 30 to 40 hours a week, since she branched out to other ventures like YouTube.",
      "Brandon also sells digital products on Etsy, and he's been doing it for nearly a decade. He shared that after four months of selling on Etsy, he was making more than his full-time job as a certified electrician.",
      "So, for two years, he used the passive income generated from Etsy (around $4,000 to $5,000 in profit per month) to travel and pay down student debt. Now, his digital products generate around 18,000 Canadian dollars, or $13,000, of revenue per month. (Insider verified this with documentation of his earnings.)\u00a0",

      "When Adam Aron's phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number in March 2022, he recognized the name of the sender: Mia.",
      "\"Is my memory right that you were into ballet?\" Aron replied.",
      "The woman on the other end played along: \"Yes!\" she replied.",
      "And so began the text exchange that would quickly turn from flirty to explicit \u2014 and within weeks morph into extortion of Aron, who is AMC's CEO.",
      "The sender was not actually named Mia. It was Sakoya Blackwood, the mastermind of an elaborate blackmail scheme that would land her in jail. Five months after sending her first text, she was indicted by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, who charged her with extortion and cyberstalking. She pleaded guilty this summer, and earlier this month, Aron confirmed a Semafor report that he was the unnamed CEO in the case.",
      "It's not Aron's first time in the spotlight. He became something of a household name when, in 2021, he embraced the meme-stock craze, taking on a larger-than-life persona that helped AMC's stock surge. He appeared to take advantage of the craze, cashing out shares worth at least $40 million over the course of a few months. The move earned him the title of \"villain of the year\" by the Hollywood pundit Matthew Belloni and drew ire from analysts. (Aron also drew headlines that year for appearing to wear no pants during a Zoom call).",
      "Soon, Aron, who did not respond to Insider's request for comment, would fall victim to another sort of villain. Charging documents describe in detail Blackwood's \"sophisticated and devious\" catfishing scheme against him.",
      "Here's how it went down.",
      "It all started with that March text. It's unknown how Blackwood got Aron's phone number, but at the time she must have assumed he was wealthy. She'd read about him online and his well-documented selling spree of AMC stock, charging documents said.",
      "She was discreet and sent the text from a voice over internet protocol, or VoIP, so it couldn't be traced. A lawyer for Blackwood did not respond to Insider's request for comment.",
      "She was also smart, according to a sentencing memo written by her lawyers. She had been a straight-A student at Evander Childs High School in the Bronx, graduating at the top of the class of 2006 and scoring well on her SATs, the memo said. But because of her immigration status \u2014 she arrived in the US illegally from Jamaica as a child \u2014\u00a0she had no options when it came to financing college.",
      "So she worked a number of odd jobs \u2014 at a day care and as a nanny \u2014\u00a0all off the books, her lawyers said. But during the pandemic, she tried two new pursuits: day-trading and posing as a minor to try to lure men into seemingly illegal sexual conversations. Blackwood's lawyers said the latter pursuit was a result of unspecified mental and physical abuse against her by someone close to her.",
      "This \"resentment toward her abusers\" may have led her to text Aron \u2014 a wealthy, powerful man in the public eye, her lawyers said. (Though the indictment said \"there is not a shred of evidence\" of Aron having a history of sexual abuse or harassment.)",
      "The message could have easily gone unanswered \u2014 had it not been for Blackwood's choice of name: Mia.",
      "Aron recognized the name, linking her to a ballet dancer who had done \"unmentionable things\" \u2014 in his words, over text \u2014\u00a0to him just a few years earlier.",
      "\"Send me a naughty picture,\" Blackwood texted, a couple weeks into their flirty exchange.",
      "He complied, sending some photos of himself solo and with another woman. When he asked for photos in return, Blackwood sent him images of an unnamed Russian model that she pulled from Instagram. Aron seemed to either not notice or not care that the woman in the pictures was not his ballerina paramour.",
      "Blackwood is no stranger to fake identities, and Mia is one of many she's assumed over the years. Law enforcement found at least five forms of fake identification in her home, including two Arizona driver's licenses, one New York City ID card, one California driver's license, and the badge of a Mount Sinai doctor. The indictment refers to her as Sakoya Blackwood, Koya Blackwood Fews, and, inexplicably, Lila Cohen.",
      "In her plot against Aron, she proved herself a master of digital disguise.",
      "On April 15, after nearly a month of flirtatious texts with Aron, Blackwood sent Aron a text from another phone number posing as \"Brian,\" the \"ex-boyfriend\" of \"Mia.\"",
      "\"Brian\" had seen some \"incendiary shit\" on Mia's phone and was \"probably selling the information,\" Blackwood texted under her new alias, floating the possibility of reaching out to the National Enquirer \u2014 a tabloid infamous for shelling out for juicy stories.",
      "\"Ceo scandal is apparently lucrative,\" Blackwood texted, posing as Brian. She threatened to sell the pictures and spread a false rumor that Aron had been intimate with a minor.",
      "By then, Aron realized he'd been caught up in some kind of trouble, and that he'd never actually met Mia. He consulted an attorney. The the next day, Blackwood, posing as Brian, threatened to text AMC board members the illicit photos.",
      "\"Offers are coming in like crazy ppl love a scandal,\" Blackwood wrote under the guise of Brian.",
      "Meanwhile, on a separate line, Blackwood posed as Mia and discouraged Aron from hiring legal help.",
      "\"He could do more damage than you could while getting paid for doing it,\" she said, referring to Brian.",
      "A few days later, Blackwood introduced a third fake identity: the representative of a media agency, who claimed they'd gotten a tip on Aron. It \"promised to be damning.\"",
      "That's when Blackwood began to work the phone as all three of her characters and tried to lock down a payout.",
      "As the \"media contact,\" she informed Aron that an outlet would be buying the photos for $250,000. As Mia, she suggested Aron inform his family, because Brian was \"going for the money.\"",
      "\"smart move was u should've been trying to make a deal,\" she texted, posing as Brian \u2014 and added that a bidding war had sent the price of the Aron scoop to $315,000.",
      "It was just nine days after Blackwood had first posed as Brian, and Aron's world was in a tailspin. He'd reached out to the FBI, and the story was only getting more bizarre.",
      "Under the alias of Mia, Blackwood said she sold her eggs, raising $300,000 to pay off Brian and save Aron. But Brian didn't want to take her money: Aron had to pay, himself, or Brian would go to the media, according to Blackwood's elaborate plot.",
      "That same day, she took her scheme to Twitter.",
      "\"I have it on extremely good authority there's a scandal brewing around @CEOAdam he's too busy threatening ppl with his attorney to care abt shareholders. Who do u think will replace him?\" she tweeted from the handle TwoTruth1.",
      "I have it on extremely good authority there's a scandal brewing around @CEOAdam he's too busy threatening ppl with his attorney to care abt shareholders. Who do u think will replace him?",
      "But the tweets got no traction \u2014 and Aron didn't bite. Blackwood didn't stand down. She invented persona No. 4 (five if you count the Twitter account) in June. This time, it was a Vanity Fair reporter.",
      "\"I was shown some images and I was wondering if you're available to speak,\" the fake reporter texted Aron.",
      "By July, when Aron still hadn't paid up, Blackwood sent a text as Brian that said: \"A porn site just reached out to me looking for the pics.\"",
      "In the background, law enforcement was tracking down Blackwood. She was arrested at her home in the Bronx on August 21, 2022, and never shared Aron's photos.",
      "It was the end of the five-month saga Aron had been living out on his cellphone.",
      "The details as laid out in the court documents read like something out of a soap opera: A wealthy man is lured by a fake former fling and falls victim to a blackmail scheme. There's money, sex, deception, and a cast of characters.",
      "But while Aron was \"suffering from the constant fear that his life would be ruined,\" according to the filings, he was also continuing his normal Twitter antics \u2014\u00a0sharing photos of his face imposed on the body of an ape (he's known to his fans, called the apes, as \"silverback\") and video of an airplane banner ad reading \"AMC to the moon.\"",
      "The case was officially closed in July, when Blackwood was sentenced to time served and three years of supervised release. But the mystery of the CEO at the center of the scandal wasn't revealed until earlier this month, when Aron came clean.",
      "\"Rather than give in to blackmail, I personally engaged counsel and other professional advisors and reported the matter to law enforcement,\" Aron tweeted. \"I did so knowing I risked personal embarrassment. But with my access to resources, if I did not stand up against blackmail, who could?\"",
      "Aron seemed to be taking a page from Jeff Bezos' book. In 2019, when Bezos was still CEO of Amazon, he outed himself as sending racy texts to his now fianc\u00e9e Lauren Sanchez \u2014 also known as \"alive girl\" \u2014 before the National Enquirer could.",
      "\"Of course I don't want personal photos published, but I also won't participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption,\" Bezos wrote at the time. \"I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\"",
      "Aron hasn't shared how going public with the attempted extortion has affected his personal life \u2014 he is, after all, married \u2014\u00a0but it hasn't been great for AMC. The theater chain's stock had been climbing after the successful release of Taylor Swift's \"Eras Tour\" film; though the stock dropped 14% when investors found out Aron was tied up in this mess. It's down 42% year over year.",
      "In a statement to Semafor, AMC's board said that it \"determined it was a personal matter, and considers the issue resolved.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Aron seems unfazed \u2014 at least publicly. He's been tweeting out images of trophies and lauding the success of the Swift movie in drawing box-office sales.",
      "The real test may be whether or not the apes decide to enact revenge.",

      "\"Live experiences are the new luxury good,\" Kevin Hartz said in 2013 when Eventbrite, the ticketing startup he cofounded, got a big new funding round.",
      "By that point, modern factories, supply chains, and Amazon had boiled down \"stuff\" to a commodity. You can now buy an overwhelming variety of tennis shoes, or spatulas, or sweatpants online. This abundance has taken much of the satisfaction away from purchasing physical things. This is why experiences, which by definition are finite, became more valuable.",
      "There are only a few opportunities to see Taylor Swift on stage, versus the availability to purchase more than 20,000 kinds of tennis shoes on Amazon. So the price of Eras tickets soar, and shoes are cheap.",
      "The same inevitable supply-and-demand dynamic is about to wash over us again with large language models and generative AI.",

      "AI models can now automatically generate text, software code, medical diagnoses, images, voices, music, video, and lots more.\u00a0The barriers to using this technology are falling away quickly. Anyone can fire up ChatGPT, GPT-4, DALL-E and other tools to produce an almost unlimited quantity of content.",
      "This should be a boon to society. Many tasks will be completed more efficiently, making products and services more affordable and accessible, as venture capitalist Marc Andreessen recently explained.",
      "There will be a reaction though: In a world of machine-generated abundance, human-centered services and experiences will become increasingly rare, valuable, and therefore desirable.",
      "\"The world's information is being turned into 1s and 0s and all this is being commoditized,\" Hartz said when I caught up with him recently. \"What can't be commoditized is finite resources like real estate, travel, seeing the sunset on Mediterranean, or surfing in Fiji. These are the luxury goods of the power elite.\"",
      "The more that AI automates restaurants, the more we'll want personal chefs such as John Barone, who cooks five days a week in the home of a wealthy Silicon Valley couple.",
      "As AI tutor bots proliferate in education, the richest will pay for more exclusive access to the best human tutors for their kids.",

      "\"And our own machines will read those AI automated sales emails,\" Hartz quipped.",
      "So, either your marketing email won't reach the humans you're trying to engage, or another AI bot will open it and you'll never be quite sure who read the message. A hand-typed email from a real human will be, relatively speaking, a rare and beautiful thing (complete with typos).",
      "AI models are beginning to revolutionize education, according to Sal Khan, the founder of Khan Academy. His organization has been working with OpenAI models to coach students in powerful new ways and help teachers develop class plans.",
      "The gold standard throughout history has always been to have a personal tutor, and AI models can help personalize the education experience to bring some of this curated approach to more students, he explained during a No Priors podcast earlier this year.",

      "Castillja in Palo Alto highlights a student to faculty ratio of 7 to 1. Nueva, a Silicon Valley school for gifted kids, promises a similar ratio. The Menlo School in Menlo Park says it has a student-teacher ratio of 10 to 1 in the upper school.",
      "These institutions cost $58,000 to $60,000 a year and I don't see any drop-off in demand among the tech elite. They're still jostling to get their kids into these bespoke, human-centered learning environments.",

      "Early in the pandemic, Bryan Roque lost his job as a software engineer at Amazon. Part of him was relieved. He'd been working himself to the bone for months on end, and he felt completely burned out. But the timing was tough: The company was dumping him into the worst job market since the Great Depression.",
      "Roque called his parents to give them the bad news, then packed up his apartment and moved back in with them. He eventually found a new job, a position at IBM that was fully remote, but an underlying anxiety stayed with him. \"It just felt like I had no control,\" he told me. \"I didn't like that I was under the whims of a company that gets to decide whether I'm employed or not.\"",
      "So less than a year into the job at IBM, when a recruiter from Meta came calling, Roque had a thought. The normal thing would be to quit his old job and accept the new position, which was also fully remote. But what if he kept his old job, and secretly took on the new one, too? All he had to do was two-time IBM, and he could double his income as well as his job security.",
      "As he mulled the idea, he discovered that he wasn't alone. There's a whole community of professionals online who trade tips about juggling jobs on the sly. They describe themselves as \"overemployed\" \u2014 and remarkably, they seem to be getting away with it. Helping them evade detection is a guy who goes by the pseudonym Isaac, who started the blog Overemployed in 2021 to share his secrets as the OG overemployed worker. Today there are some 300,000 members of the community on Discord and Reddit who celebrate one another's successes, commiserate on their failures, and swap secrets for fooling their bosses.",
      "So Roque set out to join them. He clinched an offer from Meta, landed another from Tinder, and after negotiating the two against each other for more pay, he accepted both jobs \u2014 in addition to keeping his gig at IBM. Fifteen months earlier, he'd been unemployed. Now he was suddenly employed three times over \u2014 and on track to earn a combined salary of more than $820,000 a year.",
      "Holding down multiple jobs has long been a backbreaking way for low-wage workers to get by. But since the pandemic, the phenomenon has been on the rise among professionals like Roque, who have seized on the privacy provided by remote work to secretly take on two or more jobs \u2014 multiplying their paychecks without working much more than a standard 40-hour workweek. The move is not only culturally taboo, but it's also a fireable offense \u2014 one that could expose the cheaters to a lawsuit if they're caught. To learn their methods and motivations, I spent several weeks hanging out among the overemployed online. What, I wondered, does this group of W-2 renegades have to tell us about the nature of work \u2014 and of loyalty \u2014 in the age of remote employment?",
      "Before immersing yourself in the overemployed forums, it helps to know some of the lingo. Those who consider themselves OE rank each of their jobs by the priority they place on it. J1 is the favorite, the one they'll tend to before the others. J2 is the backup, J3 is the backup of the backup, and so on. The trick is to maximize your TC (total compensation) while minimizing your HPW (hours worked per week on each job). If you see inexplicable references to gaming (e.g., \"Should I take on a 3rd Minecraft server?\") that's just code for an OE job. They know that outsiders \u2014 maybe even their bosses \u2014 are lurking on the forums, so they try to create the impression they're talking about something innocent, the way a mobster might talk about accepting a \"contract\" to \"do a piece of work.\"",
      "This commitment to secrecy is the first pillar of the OE ethos. They freeze their employment histories with Equifax and hibernate their LinkedIn profiles, so employers can't see they're holding multiple jobs. They tell no one what they're up to, barring their spouse and maybe their accountant \u2014 hence their many references to \"Fight Club.\" When a coworker sends them some article about OE, they feign surprise. There's no way I could handle two jobs when I'm so busy with just one! The first rule of OE is you do not talk about OE.",
      "The OE hustlers have some tried-and-true hacks. Taking on a second or third full-time job? Given how time-consuming the onboarding process can be, you should take a week or two of vacation from your other jobs. It helps if you can stagger your jobs by time zone \u2014 perhaps one that operates during New York hours, say, and another on California time. Keep separate work calendars for each job \u2014 but to avoid double-bookings, be sure to block off all your calendars as soon as a new meeting gets scheduled. And don't skimp on the tech that will make your life a bit easier. Mouse jigglers create the appearance that you're online when you're busy tending to your other jobs. A KVM switch helps you control multiple laptops from the same keyboard.",
      "Some OE hustlers brag about shirking their responsibilities. For them, being overemployed is all about putting one over on their employers. But most in the community take pride in doing their jobs, and doing them well. That, after all, is the single best way to avoid detection: Don't give your bosses \u2014 any of them \u2014 a reason to become suspicious.",
      "\"The main reason people get caught is because they're slacking,\" says George, a software engineer who's held as many as four jobs at a time. \"I've never been caught. I actually do the work.\" (All the OEers I interviewed, with the exception of Bryan Roque, agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity.) Does working multiple full-time jobs require burning the midnight oil? Sure, once in a while, when the shit hits the fan at all your companies at the same time. But for the most part, people average no more than 50 hours of work a week, and usually closer to 40. So what's their secret to condensing their workloads to what should be an 80-, or 120-, or 160-hour workweek?",
      "Mostly, they're just really, really good at their jobs, which enables them to work fast. \"I'm at the top of my game now,\" says Allison, a woman with 16 years of experience in her field who took on two full-time roles. \"And when I was applying for the second job, I made sure it was well within what I know to be my skillset.\" One OE strategy, in fact, is to intentionally seek out roles that are too junior for you. That ensures the assignments you get will be pretty easy.",
      "Those with multiple jobs also seek out positions they hope will be OE-friendly \u2014 light on meetings, as well as on the workload. The process requires a lot of trial and error, like trading cards until you get the perfect hand. Cole, a software engineer, started looking for a J2 because his J1 required so little work \u2014 often as little as two or three hours a week. \"I just felt like I had a lot of extra time on my hands,\" he says, \"and I figured I could use that time more productively than just watching videos on YouTube.\" But he's been forced to cycle through several J2s, looking for a role that matches his J1. \"I haven't found the same work-life balance and compensation at another job,\" he says.",
      "The consequences for getting caught actually appear to be fairly low. Matthew Berman, an employment attorney who has emerged as the unofficial go-to lawyer in the OE community, hasn't encountered anyone who has been hit with a lawsuit for holding a second job. \"Most of the time, it's not going to be worth suing an employee,\" he says. But many say the stress of the OE life can get to you. George, the software engineer, has trouble sleeping at night because of his fear of getting caught. Others acknowledge that the rigors of juggling multiple jobs have hurt their marriages. One channel on the OE Discord is dedicated to discussions of family life, mostly among dads with young kids. People in the channel sometimes ask for relationship advice, and the responses they get from the other dads are sweet. \"Your regard for your partner,\" one person advised of marriage, \"should outweigh your desire for validation.\"",
      "One concern that's dominating the OE forums these days is the return-to-office push underway at many companies. What do you do if one of your employers requires you to start showing up in person? That's what happened to Roque, the IBM-Meta-Tinder engineer, when Meta asked him to come into the office a couple of days a week. Sometimes he wasn't able to book a conference room to take his Tinder and IBM calls in privacy, leading to some nerve-racking conversations out in Meta's open-plan office, where anyone might overhear him. One time he accidentally connected his Tinder laptop to Meta's WiFi network, rather than using his phone's hot spot, and Tinder immediately noticed. It was a close call: When Tinder asked why he was remoting in from Meta, he quickly improvised a story about how he was working at a friend's office. \"They basically told me, 'Oh, just so you know, we recommend you don't do that,'\" he said. \"I was like, 'Makes sense.'\"",
      "Job jugglers in the OE forums often post about how much money they're making. One person claimed to be earning $2 million from nine jobs; a few others posted about making $1 million. But those whose earnings I was able to verify are earning less than that. Isaac, the founder of the Overemployed blog, makes about $600,000 from his two tech jobs. Cole, a software engineer, makes about $500,000. At her peak, Allison was making $260,000 from her jobs as a business analyst and a product manager.",
      "What job jugglers don't brag about, oddly, is how they spend their money. I kept looking for flashy anecdotes about fast cars and luxury vacations, but all anyone seemed to talk about was saving \u2014 and then saving some more. If the first pillar of OE is secrecy, the second is frugality. Many in the community turn out to be adherents of the movement known as FIRE, short for Financial Independence, Retire Early. George, who is in his 20s, told me he's on track to retire by the time he's 35. The overemployed prioritize paying down their credit-card debt, student loans, and mortgages. The one splurge I saw someone proudly volunteer was tickets to a Taylor Swift concert for their daughter. When newbies post their success stories, veterans chime in with sober warnings about what they call lifestyle creep. \"OE is about financial security,\" one recently advised. \"If you inflate your lifestyle, you lose that.\"",
      "There's another incentive: Unlike most Americans, those who work multiple jobs don't have to worry about layoffs. For Roque, that relief outweighed the stress of his added workload and the vigilance required to keep his three jobs a secret. \"I didn't have to worry about being super-dependent on one company,\" he told me. \"I had control over whether I had an income or not.\" Still, he ultimately wound up replacing his jobs at IBM and Meta and Tinder with a single new one, to give himself time to enjoy other pursuits.",
      "But what I really wanted to know \u2014 what interested me the most \u2014 is whether those who are overemployed feel guilty about what they're doing. There's no way around the fact that they're breaking the rules: In exchange for a salary, they promised not to work for anyone else. Did they feel bad about breaking that promise?",
      "The forums include quite a few posts in the screw-the-man tenor you see all over Reddit \u2014 one person boasted about being a \"monetary mercenary.\" But the overemployed I spoke with came across like decent people. They genuinely seem to care about fulfilling their obligations to the people around them.",
      "\"There is a certain moral ick to taking two jobs,\" George says. \"I have some really nice bosses, so the way I compensate is by going the extra mile.\"",
      "Allison says she worried, at first, that she was taking a job that could have gone to someone who didn't have one. With unemployment at 3.9%, there are plenty of jobs to go around right now \u2014 but it's a legitimate concern, especially given all the recent layoffs in the tech industry. Allison ultimately justified taking a second job because her husband wasn't working so he could care for older family members. As a couple, she reasons, they still have the same number of jobs as a normal dual-income household.",
      "Others say they don't feel bad for a simpler reason: because they do the work that's required of them. \"They're happy with what I'm producing,\" says Cole, who's been promoted twice at his J1 since he started taking on second jobs. \"I don't feel bad about what I'm doing with the rest of my time.\"",
      "Many bosses, of course, would argue that they're paying these employees to work full-time. If you get your work done quickly, the traditional expectation is you should let your supervisor know you're available to take on more tasks. You owe it to your company to put in the hours you're being paid for \u2014 all of them.",
      "But that's precisely what many of the overemployed say they used to do, back in their days as career monogamists. And what did that get them? A lousy raise that got wiped out by inflation. Unmet promises of a promotion. Layoffs at the first sign of turmoil, delivered by a single email that shuts you out of the company's system with no warning. Loyalty, they decided, doesn't pay. If you can't trust one employer to do right by you, better to have two or three of them as backups.",
      "At its core, overemployment represents a new social contract being forged in an era that has left the old, unspoken agreement around work \u2014 \"stick with us for life and we'll treat you like family\" \u2014 in tatters. Professionals in the OE forums are looking for a way that will more reliably reward them for their talents \u2014 even if it requires an ungodly degree of risk tolerance and a champion-level poker face. \"My parents told me, 'Don't switch companies, grow in one company, be loyal to one company, and they'll be loyal to you,'\" George says. \"That may have been true in their days, but it definitely isn't today anymore.\"",
      "The thing is, employers themselves have started moving in the direction of hiring people who have multiple jobs. Since the pandemic, many companies have been bringing on more independent contractors, who are often paid by the project, not by the hour. Critically, these gigs come with no expectation of loyalty. As I reported earlier this year, that's terrifying for us normies, who depend on our employer to provide us with health insurance and other benefits. But it's a good thing for the overemployed. Many in the OE community, in fact, have taken advantage of the trend by getting a full-time J1 that provides them with health insurance and then taking J2s and J3s that are contractor positions, which often come with higher pay to compensate for the lack of benefits.",
      "The pandemic-era rise of remote and hybrid work has also introduced employers to a new way of measuring productivity. Instead of tracking the number of hours that employees log at their desks, many supervisors are now evaluating employees based on the actual work they produce. Given this more flexible, results-oriented approach to management, some bosses may get to the point where they don't care about an employee's second job, as long as the work they're getting from the employee is first-rate. \"I got 'exceeds' on my reviews for both jobs last year,\" Allison says. \"It's hard to feel guilty when you're doing what you're supposed to be doing.\"",
      "But there's a strong argument to be made that the overemployed could actually wind up fueling a backlash from bosses. Many CEOs have already grown suspicious of remote work, convinced that work-from-home employees are taking advantage of them, and reports of two-timing scofflaws only serve to confirm those fears. From a traditional management perspective, the idea that experienced employees can finish their job in far less than 40 hours a week argues for either (1) giving full-time staffers more work or (2) replacing them with independent contractors. \"I think people who do this stuff really just make it worse for everyone else in the long run,\" one Redditor wrote in a much-villified post on the subreddit r/overemployed. \"Not here to hate. Just want you guys to rethink what you're doing.\"",
      "There's no way to know exactly how many job jugglers there are. In September, McKinsey & Company estimated that those it calls \"double-dippers\" constitute 5% of a typical organization's staff. That strikes me as way too high. Last quarter, the government estimated that 412,000 Americans are working two full-time jobs at the same time, up by 105,000 since 2019. Since most of those are almost certainly blue-collar workers struggling to get by, OE professionals likely comprise far less than 1% of the white-collar workforce. It's still a niche phenomenon.",
      "But I think the bosses of the world are threatened by OE for a deeper reason \u2014 one that goes beyond the numbers. There's something radical that happens to a worker's psychology when they have multiple jobs. If your company is putting a roof over your head, it's hard not to fall into a hustle-culture mentality at work, doing whatever it takes to satisfy your boss. That dependence is \"a big mental weight that I think a lot of people carry with them,\" Isaac, the OE blogger, told me. \"They go a little harder because they have to.\" But because the overemployed are no longer wholly dependent on any one employer, each job starts to look a little more disposable \u2014 which, if we're being honest, is precisely how many CEOs view their employees. On the forums, when someone complains about being unhappy at their J2 or their J3, the responses pour in. Time to drop that shitty job, they say. This is why we OE.",
      "Allison recently faced such a dilemma. Her new boss at her J1 kept dumping more and more work on her, until she eventually found herself running a whole team of employees. All she wanted was a promotion, and maybe a $10,000 raise, to compensate her for the additional responsibilities she was forced to take on. But her employer refused. Before, she would have stuck it out, dependent on her job to support her and her family. But this time she had the backup of a great J2, which gave her the freedom to walk away. When she quit, the company posted her opening as a manager role \u2014 and asked her whether she'd come back for the better job title and higher pay she had wanted all along. She declined.",
      "\"This is a pervasive thing in my career,\" she says. \"I'll be told, 'Hey, we're going to groom you to promote you,' and then something will happen and that promotion just won't come through. I realized that if I wanted to improve my family's financial health, I was going to have to take a different tactic, and this is what I chose.\" She promised her husband that she'll take it easy for a few months in her J2, which is now her J1. But the truth is, she's already started scrolling through job postings on LinkedIn and Indeed. She'll start applying in earnest in the new year. The winner will be her new J2.",

      "The reason? Taylor Swift. Ever since the pop phenom first showed up to cheer on her rumored beau, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, at Arrowhead stadium on September 24th, the Midwestern city has been feeling bejeweled.",
      "The shop has sold out of a T-shirt emblazoned with \"Who's Travis Kelce Anyway? Ew\" \u2014\u00a0a play on the \"22\" lyric \u2014 and a \"Red Zone Taylor's Version\" T-shirt and sweatshirt featuring images of Swift and Kelce. The downtown store has been flooded with in-person shoppers, and online orders for Swift-themed products are way up.",
      "Westside Storey is one of several Kansas City businesses Insider spoke with that have seen a Swiftmania bump in sales. The crowds at Westside Storey are especially big on game days, when sales have spiked between 30 and 40%. Meanwhile, ticket sales for Chiefs games have soared.",
      "\"We've seen people kind of trying to copy her style and coming in and finding the best vintage sweatshirt that looks just like hers and wearing those to the games, which is fun,\" Folmsbee said. Recently, the store fielded \"a pretty interesting order\" for Chiefs apparel that they they've had fun speculating came from Swift's team.",
      "They're not alone: Swiftmania has seized Kansas City, and the next great American dynasty \u2014 of a blockbuster football team and pop music superstar \u2014 is invigorating the Midwestern city.",

      "When Ericka Hamilton and Misha Wilson, sisters who own a jewelry store, saw Swift at her first Chiefs game on September 24th, they got an idea. The duo happen to be friends with Randi Mahomes, the mother of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. So Hamilton and Wilson quickly made several custom stackable bracelets \u2014\u00a0a signature of their Arkansas-based store, Erimish \u2014\u00a0and gave them to Randi to deliver to Swift.",

Images of the singer wearing the bracelet quickly went viral on social media and fueled the media obsession with the new romance. Sales of the \"87\" bracelet were up 300% the day after the game, Erimish's head of retail sales, Sarah Fretwell, told Insider. The store has also seen a \"dramatic increase\" in sales of their other custom jewelry, a surge in website traffic, and lots of calls, emails, and social media callouts, she added.",

But newer data has found office workers are back to 72% of their pre-pandemic numbers, and tourism has surged.",

Kansas City's Union Station movie theater told Insider it's already sold over 7,300 tickets to the Eras Tour movie playing on its extra-large \"Extreme Screen.\"",

      "Meanwhile, Dolce Bakery \u2014 a locally-owned small business \u2014 started baking up Taylor Swift-themed cakes to mark her arrival for the Eras Tour. They haven't really stopped since; owner Erin Brown estimated that they've sold somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 cakes, with a \"ton\" of orders already set for Friday's 1989 Taylor's Version release. The cakes were the brainchild of the bakery's creative director Katlyn Howard, a huge Swiftie who essentially did a riff on the bakery's Valentine's Day heart cakes. Those took off, as has the bakery's social media \u2014 another example of the Swift effect on Kansas City.",
      "\"That's brought in new customers, which is always fun and always a goal to serve more of our community in that way,\" Brown said. \"I mean, boosted sales are a dream for a small business.\"",
      "Of course, it's unclear how long the Swift bump will last. While recent history shows that everything Swift touches turns to economic gold, the frenzy might calm a bit if she becomes a more permanent fixture in Kansas City.",

Local barbecue joint Jack Stack reportedly catered Kelce's post-game victory party; when reached by Insider, a Jack Stack representative said they were unable to respond due to an NDA.",

An Argentine steakhouse Swift and Kelce reportedly dined at on October 23rd wouldn't confirm or deny the couple's visit and wouldn't comment on Swift's impact on their business.",
      "But there might be a more long-term shift. Visit KC said that, anecdotally, Swift's time in Kansas City has caught the eye of international travel media and travel industry professionals. Patrick Joyce, the director of sales at Kansas City's swanky Raphael Hotel, told Insider that the hotel has been busy this Chiefs season.",
      "\"When you're in the lobby and listening to people talk about things that are going on, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are also often one of the common topics by incoming people,\" Joyce said. When people sit in the stands of the game, or dine at the same restaurants as Taylor and Travis, \"they kind of feel like they're a part of it,\" he said.",
      "Indeed, Lonely Planet included Kansas City on its list of top destinations to visit in 2024 released on Thursday.",
      "\"Suddenly in the international spotlight after Taylor Swift's appearance at the Chiefs football game, Kansas City is on our radar for lots of reasons,\" the travel guide wrote in its blurb on Kansas City. Beyond Taylor, they praise a new airport terminal, a streetcar extension, and a growing entertainment district.",
      "While Swift is not single-handedly responsible for the Kansas City renaissance, her presence is currently being felt in the wallets and streets of Kansas City. After all, who knows if she never showed up, what could've been?",

      "Consumers have tended to fund their big-ticket purchases by dipping into their leftover COVID-era savings \u2013\u00a0and it looks like the enormous cash pile is about to finally run out.",
      "The personal savings rate gauge of disposable income peaked at a whopping 32% at the onset of the pandemic in April 2020 but has steadily declined in recent years, falling from 5.3% to just 3.4% this summer alone.",
      "\u00a0",
      "The tumbling savings rate has tended to get lost amid the clamor about the US dodging a recession and its surprisingly resilient job market \u2013\u00a0but Americans' cash stockpiles running dry could drag on growth and kill off funflation, according to ADM ISI's Ostwald.",
      "\"Will it last? No,\" he said. \"You've run down the savings rate so a lot of people have basically been spending well beyond what they've been earning. You've got other headwinds now, things like student loan repayments restarting, and other risks like the autoworkers' strike.\"",
      "Higher interest rates are also likely to make funflation a temporary trend.",
      "Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has jacked up borrowing costs from near-zero to around 5.5% in a bid to tame inflation \u2013 and while monetary policy tends to have a lagged impact, that's already started to squeeze Americans' wallets.",
      "The Fed's tightening campaign has driven the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to an eye-popping 7.8%, according to data from Freddie Mac, while unemployment has also steadily crept up in recent months.",
      "\"A large chunk of [GDP] strength came from temporary factors \u2013 the 'Barbenheimer' summer blockbusters, and concert tours by Taylor Swift and Beyonce,\" Bloomberg economist Eliza Winger said in a preview for the US's third-quarter growth numbers.",
      "\"The Fed has raised its benchmark rate by a cumulative 5.25 percentage points to slow the economy, and it's likely that some of the long and variable lags of monetary policy on the economy have yet to fully play out,\" she added.",
      "In other words, it's easier to talk yourself into spending thousands of dollars on a second-hand ticket for the \"Eras Tour\" if you see it as a one-off post-COVID blowout \u2013\u00a0and much harder to justify if you're worrying about buying a house or losing your job.",
      "That's why the Taylor Swift economy isn't likely to last.",

      "The report puts Swift's current net worth at $1.1 billion, thanks in part to her massive 146-date worldwide Eras Tour. The US leg of the zeitgeist-defining show added $4.3 billion to the country's gross domestic product alone, according to Bloomberg Economics.",
      "In July, Forbes estimated Swift had a net worth upwards of $740 million \u2014 with her real estate profile worth over $80 million alone.",

The move saved her from being sued for endorsing the corrupt crypto exchange \u2014 other celebrities, like Larry David and Shaquille O'Neal, are now caught up in a lawsuit for their endorsements. ",
      "Swift is one of the few people to reach billionaire status almost exclusively from her music and performances, the outlet reported, citing publicly disclosed and traceable assets and earnings. Her fortune is primarily comprised of her expensive discography, five homes, and earnings from streaming deals, music sales, concert tickets, and merchandise, according to Bloomberg.",

      "Far-right commentators are putting the blame for the GOP's major election losses during Tuesday's races on one celeb: Taylor Swift.",
      "On Tuesday, the pop superstar encouraged her fans to vote in their local elections, writing on Instagram: \"Voters gonna vote!\"",
      "\"It's Election Day! If you are registered to vote in Colorado, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas or Virginia, it's time to use your voice,\" Swift wrote, sharing a link to Vote.org.",
      "Though Swift didn't explicitly endorse anyone in this election, right-wing hosts bemoaned the power of the Swifties.",
      "Activist Jack Posobiec said in a Wednesday post to his more than 2.3 million followers on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, that the billionaire global pop sensation was \"influencing an army of voters.\"",
      "\"Republicans still haven't internalized that the Left promotes abortion as a pro-feminism issue. They aren't voting to kill babies, they're voting bc of feminist movies like Barbie and pop stars like Taylor Swift influencing an army of voters,\" Posobiec wrote.",
      "He fumed in another all-caps post that \"THE CHILDLESS, UNMARRIED ABORTION ARMY MOBILIZED BY BARBIE, TAYLOR SWIFT, AND TIKTOK\" was \"CRUSHING REPUBLICANS AT THE BALLOT BOX.\"",
      "Far-right firebrand media personality Charlie Kirk also went after Swift on his talk radio show on Wednesday, saying that the Republican Party \"better have a plan\" for the \"Anti-Hero\" singer's influence over young voters.",
      "\"Taylor Swift is going to come out in the presidential election and she is going to mobilize her fans,\" Kirk warned his viewers on Wednesday, adding, \"And we're going to be like, 'Oh wow, where did all these young, female voters come from?' We better have a plan for that.\"",
      "Kirk continued: \"All the Swifties want is swift abortion. That's what they want. It's 100%.\"",
      "The right-wing host then took a shot at Swift, saying, \"We act as if she is like Mother Mary or something. Newsflash, she ain't Mother Mary.\"",
      "Swift broke her long political silence in 2018 to endorse two Democratic candidates from Tennessee. She also expressed her support for LGBTQ rights and condemned systemic racism.",
      "The music superstar announced ahead of the 2020 election that her White House pick was President Joe Biden and this year has urged her more than 270 million Instagram followers to register to vote, leading to \"record-breaking\" registrations.",
      "Reps for Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Insider on Thursday.",
      "Posobiec and Kirk's commentary comes after Democrats saw a wave of major victories in Tuesday's elections. Among them included Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear's re-election win in Kentucky, Democrats winning majorities in Virginia's state House of Delegates and state Senate, and Ohio voters approving a measure to codify the right to an abortion in the state's constitution.",
      "Some Republican White House hopefuls blamed former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, for the GOP's Tuesday election losses.",
      "But Republican strategist Doug Heye suggested to the Washington Examiner that that's a stretch.",
      "\"We've set up a construct in America where everything has to be viewed through the prism of either Donald Trump or Taylor Swift, and that's not reality,\" Heye told the news outlet.",
      "Meanwhile, Swifties on TikTok seemed to be relishing the attention.",

      "Taylor Swift has one. Leonardo DiCaprio has a handful. David Attenborough? Too many to count.\u00a0",
      "The list of species named for celebrities is lengthy and includes everything from flies (Beyonc\u00e9) to lichen (Oprah Winfrey) to lizards (Lionel Messi).\u00a0",
      "An eponym is a scientific species name based on a person, either real or fictional.\u00a0",
      "When scientists name a species after someone famous, it can often make headlines and draw attention to less-charismatic animals or plants, like Jimmy Buffet's snail or Lady Gaga's ferns.\u00a0",
      "Some researchers say it's a way to bring attention to spiders and other animals who are otherwise ignored. Others are simply fans or want to acknowledge celebrities' environmental activism, as with Sericomyrmex radioheadi, an ant named for the carbon-conscious band Radiohead.",
      "Certain species have physical or behavioral traits that suit a famous person or an acting role. Tarantobelus jeffdanielsi is a tarantula-killing roundworm named in honor of Jeff Daniels' character in the movie \"Arachnophobia.\"\u00a0",
      "Yet some experts see naming a species after any famous person as a recipe for \"nomenclatural regret.\" Should a celebrity fall from their pedestal, what will it mean for the spiders or slugs left in the wake of their scandal?\u00a0\u00a0",
      "A Virginia Tech researcher made headlines for naming a millipede after Taylor Swift. It seemed like a smart move, as everyday arthropods rarely make history, and this sort of publicity can help bring awareness, according to a recent paper.",
      "University of Oxford biologist Katie Blake and her co-authors found that species with celebrity names had almost three times as many page views on Wikipedia as non-famously monikered control species.",
      "But whether those views actually translate to better conservation efforts needs further study.",
      "And it's not clear if the attention is always positive, especially if the celebrity figure is more infamous than famous.\u00a0",
      "\"We need more work to better understand how species are affected when named after someone who is fairly controversial,\" Blake said. \"Not only in terms of attitudes towards these species, but conservation action, too, where needed.\"\u00a0",
      "While Blake thinks celebrity names can draw attention to amphibians and invertebrates \"who aren't exactly the public's favorite taxa, the consequences of naming them after someone who is disliked may worsen such species' conservation status.\"",
      "That's one reason why some scientists want to rename a blind cave beetle.\u00a0",
      "Part of a scientific name's appeal is that it's unchanging and the same in every language. But recently, researchers have begun proposing making changes to \"scientific names that commemorate historical individuals who committed egregious crimes against humanity.\"",
      "Christopher Bae, a professor of anthropology at the University of Hawai'i at Mano, and his colleagues were more specific, stating that names with \"tyrants, dictators, colonialists, and slave traders\" should be changed.\u00a0",
      "Some examples include Adolf Hitler, Cecil Rhodes, and George Hibbert, all of whom have species named after them.\u00a0",
      "Hitler actually has\u00a0 two insects named after him. One, the Rochlingia hitleri, has been extinct for millions of years. The other is a rare cave-dwelling beetle, Anophthalmus hitleri.\u00a0",
      "Scientists have warned that the cave beetle is threatened by poachers. \"These collectors are going out and collecting and then selling them on the internet to Neo-Nazis because they're memorabilia now,\" Bae said.\u00a0",
      "Another example is the many species named for the imperialist Cecil John Rhodes who pushed for British expansion into southern Africa and supported racial segregation.\u00a0",
      "His name is splashed across the biological world, including many plant names stemming from the Rhodesia region, what is now known as Zimbabwe and Zambia.\u00a0",
      "Right now, the debate over whether to use a Rhodes-derived name is especially pertinent for paleoanthropologists who study early human ancestors. There's a label, Homo heidelbergensis, that's such a mishmash of species, that it's no longer a meaningful designation, according to Bae. Instead, researchers want to introduce a new name for an ancestor of modern humans.\u00a0",
      "If they were to follow the traditional naming practice, then the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature's rules state that the first name given to a species gets priority on being the scientific name, so the species would be called Homo rhodesiensis. A human skull found in Zambia was given that name in 1921. ",
      "However, Bae and many of his colleagues aren't eager to start using the name Homo rhodesiensis, especially because of the significance of the species. \"This guy had some real serious issues,\" Bae said of Rhodes.",
      "Earlier this year, Bae and over a dozen other paleoanthropologists gathered to discuss the issue, and it was nearly unanimous. Almost no one was in favor of using the Rhodes-derived name.",
      "Another name, Homo bodoensis, named for Bodo D'ar, Ethiopia, where the skull was found, has been proposed instead.\u00a0",
      "There are hundreds of thousands of species with eponymous names, according to the ICZN's estimate. But Bae thinks only a fraction of them reach the level of Hitler, Hibbert, and Rhodes. To protect against frivolous changes, Bae and his co-authors called for an ethics committee to review proposals.\u00a0",
      "\"Nobody's going to really want to go after every single name out there,\" he said. \"It's really going to be the egregious ones that need to be looked at more carefully.\"\u00a0",
      "But names can be changed. Consider the Brontosaurus, which was a genus of dinosaur that was lumped together with the Apatosaurus and then separated again in 2015. The alterations are often made for scientific reasons but not always.\u00a0",
      "The American Ornithological Society is in the process of changing the common English names of bird species named after people. The organization Bird Names for Birds has pushed for the change because many of the animals are named for people who enslaved others or dug up Native American graves.\u00a0",
      "However, the birds' scientific names will remain, as they are much more difficult to change, NPR reported.",
      "\"We already have thousands of species named for people who are now obscure,\" Stephen B. Heard wrote in his book \"Charles Darwin's Barnacle and David Bowie's Spider: How Scientific Names Celebrate Adventurers, Heroes, and Even a Few Scoundrels.\"",
      "That a celebrity might fade from public consciousness isn't the worst thing that could happen, though. Case in point, Hitler's beetle.\u00a0",
      "Chances are most celebrities with eponymous species won't leave a legacy as tarnished as some powerful men of the past. Yet societal norms do change, and it's easy to see how some famous people's reputations changed after the #MeToo movement, for example.\u00a0 \u00a0",
      "And some researchers would prefer to correct the imbalance of species named mostly after European men from the 19th and 20th centuries, instead naming more species after women and native scientists. Or perhaps changing existing eponyms to be more inclusive.\u00a0",
      "As some researchers noted, \"their names will not be eliminated from history: they will simply move into synonymy,\" That is, there could one day be a footnote indicating that the species was formerly known as Hitler's beetle.\u00a0",

I've hung over 10 items on our walls this past weekend and it was a breeze with this tool. Just measure, put the tape to the wall where you want it, ensure your tape is level, and then push the marker pins in to know where you need to put in your anchors/hooks. When you're doing it solo, this tool is absolutely priceless!\" \u2014Shameel Kumar",

      "\"I've been using the Litter Robot myself for over a year now, and I'm pretty sure both me and my two cats are way happier for it. After a cat is done using it, the Litter Robot waits a set amount of time until the cat's presence is no longer detected, then begins to rotate, collecting the waste into a bag at the bottom while retaining the clean litter in the barrel. I usually don't detect a smell from it afterward, though once the bag starts to get really full, you might get a subtle reminder that you need to take it out. My cats completely adjusted after a few weeks and accepted it as their way of life, making my life a heck of a lot easier while ensuring they always have a clean bed of litter. It's a pricey purchase, to be sure, but if cleaning out the litter box daily or even every other day is hard for you and you'd rather not think about it much at all, I say the Litter Robot is worth it.\"\u00a0",

I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, but I took the photos above literally just now to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller \u2014 at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair.\u00a0It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside, which does require you to apply a bit of pressure. Afterward, you'll just dump out the hair that's been trapped inside. The ChomChom is best for large flat surfaces like couches and beds.",

Based on all the reviews, I was pretty confident I'd soon be kicking myself for not getting it sooner, and that proved to be true: This thing not only looks good, but works great for keeping my coffee warm all day long (because yes, I'm one of those people that'll sip on coffee until 5 p.m., all right!!). I was kind of worried it'd be too small for some of my larger mugs, but the center plate is bigger than expected and accommodated every mug in my (very eclectic) collection perfectly. I can confirm that flat-bottomed mugs are the best option for using with this warmer as they do stay hotter, but it still keeps my concave-bottom mugs warm enough for my taste.

I saw it recommended in a TikTok (which I can't find now, sry!) and even though it costs more than I've ever spent on foundation, I was pulled in by the idea of a hyaluronic acid\u00a0formula that's hydrating and glowy with decent coverage\u00a0 \u2014 and it's proven to be just that. The skin tone match is PERFECTION (Sephora nailed it with the \"Find Your Shade\" tool) and it blends like a dream, working as the perfect base for blush, highlighter, and more. It's lightweight and buildable, and my dry, sensitive skin has had no issues with it. As a bonus, it has SPF 27 for added protection! The bottle is also lasting me a loooong time, so it's been worth every single penny in my experience.

I'm a big fan of Taylor (obviously) but was really enamored by how beautiful the pages are. I was so excited to read this lil' biography with my son and teach him a little more about someone I adore. (Which it does a great job of doing in a pared-down way!) It's a short book, looks cute on my desk, and is a hit for bedtime story time. What more could you want???\"",

Basically, a lot of stuff ends up in the trash or pawned off on my (grateful) friends when it isn't a fit for me. But THIS STUFF. This stuff has become my go-to for spraying on my wet hair and then blow drying. Normally I'd apply a heat protector and an oil treatment or leave-in conditioner before blow drying. But this 10-in-1 treatment takes the cake! Most of the time when I use it, I don't even need to finish off my hair with hair oil (I've been doing that as an essential hair step for years now). It's really that good! Here, I have freshly blow-dried hair with just this post-shower using this Amika blow dryer brush. This brush is fantastic on its own but this spray-on treatment has more or less doubled this brush's effectiveness.

It also didn't feel heavy or sticky on my face \u2014 it didn't feel like anything at all, actually \u2014 and\u00a0my makeup looked better than it ever has after hours of wear. (For reference, I have dry, sensitive skin, and it caused me no issues.)\u00a0",
      "Soon after that event, I put it to an even bigger task: surviving sweat, tears, and 12 hours of wear for the Taylor Swift Eras Tour. My makeup look (pictured above) was done by 2 p.m., and\u00a0thanks to my now highly trusted Urban Decay spray, it stayed completely intact (minus the lipstick I purposefully wiped off while scarfing down post-concert pizza) until the time I got home just after 2 a.m.\u00a0Here's what it endured during that timespan: multi-leg public transportation to and from the venue, waiting in lines under the blaring sun to get in, several meals and drinks, jumping, screaming, and\u00a0literally full-on crying a number of times\u00a0during the show. My liquid eyeliner, eyeshadow,\u00a0non-waterproof mascara, foundation, blush, and even glitter (for the most part) were unfazed, and I owe it all to this setting spray.\"",

I tried everything to help her control this \u2014 men's deodorant, alcohol, lemon under her armpits, tea bags in her shoes, washing her clothes in vinegar etc. I was literally at my wits end by the time I came across this product on Amazon. After reading hundreds of positive reviews, I bought the soap with the hope that it would help significantly reduce her foot and armpit odor. To my amazement, it eliminated her odor completely!! She went through a whole day at school, including PE, and came home smelling as fresh as she did when she left that morning. That has NEVER happened this entire school year!! Needless to say, my husband and I are beyond pleased with our daughter's results.

This stuff has become my go-to for spraying on my wet hair and then blow drying. Normally I'd apply a heat protector and an oil treatment or leave-in conditioner before blow drying.

It also didn't feel heavy or sticky on my face \u2014 it didn't feel like anything at all, actually \u2014 and\u00a0my makeup looked better than it ever has after hours of wear.

My liquid eyeliner, eyeshadow,\u00a0non-waterproof mascara, foundation, blush, and even glitter (for the most part) were unfazed, and I owe it all to this setting spray.\"",

      "Promising review: \"This great little alarm has been a lifesaver for me! I've always been a heavy sleeper and have always struggled with running late to work. This alarm changed that for me. It\u2019s more gentle than other alarms, and it wakes you up gradually mimicking sunrise entering the bed room along with soft alarm sounds (my favorite is the birds singing). You can set up two different alarms with different settings, including the brightness of the light, the volume of the alarm sound, and snooze time! I'm also using it as a sleep aid and a white noise machine to fall asleep whenever I find myself struggling with insomnia. Besides, I live in Seattle, where it rains a lot, which sometimes gets me under the weather. Using this alarm as light therapy for depression calms me down and elevates my mood! I highly recommend this alarm to all the heavy sleepers out there. It will change your life forever.\" \u2014Talman",

It\u2019s easy to use, you just spray the front and back and pull on it for a minute to release all the wrinkles. It smells great \u2013 very fresh. Although if you\u2019re very sensitive to scents/perfumes in your detergent this might also irritate your skin since the scent is kind of strong, but it does calm down when it dries. I do have slightly sensitive skin and it\u2019s never bothered me, though. Plus, even if you do have the space to iron, it\u2019s such a time saver in the mornings and great for things like T-shirts that don\u2019t usually need to be ironed but are wrinkly. I think you would still need to iron things like dress shirts or pants, though. My mom has been using this for years, and it was great when I was a young teenager so that I didn\u2019t have to get out the iron and make my mom worry about me burning the house down.

      "BuzzFeed shopping editor, Jenae Sitzes uses this setting spray, and here's what she had to say: \"I first put this setting spray to the test for a wedding that involved taking multiple trains in and out of Manhattan on a hot day and being in crowded rooms where airflow was ~limited~. As such, I was sweating up a storm, but my makeup looked *flawless* by the time I got home that night \u2014 all thanks to this Urban Decay setting spray, which I knew after one use I'd be repurchasing. I'm new to setting sprays, so it felt weird at first to spray something *on top* of my carefully crafted makeup look, but it dried in no time without messing anything up. It also didn't feel heavy or sticky on my face \u2014 it didn't feel like anything at all, actually \u2014 and my makeup looked better than it ever has after hours of wear. (For reference, I have dry, sensitive skin, and it caused me no issues.)\u00a0",
      "\"Soon after that event, I put it to an even bigger task: surviving sweat, tears, and 12 hours of wear for the Taylor Swift Eras Tour. My makeup look (pictured above) was done by 2 p.m., and thanks to my now highly trusted Urban Decay spray, it stayed completely intact (minus the lipstick I purposefully wiped off while scarfing down post-concert pizza) until the time I got home just after 2 a.m. Here's what it endured during that timespan: multi-leg public transportation to and from the venue, waiting in lines under the blaring sun to get in, multiple meals and drinks, jumping, screaming, and literally full-on crying multiple times during the show. My liquid eyeliner, eyeshadow, non-waterproof mascara, foundation, blush, and even glitter were unfazed, and I owe it all to this setting spray.\"",

One of my brushes is made from boar hair (Est\u00e9e Lauder powder brush), and I was worried it was going to frizz out and ruin the shape, but it actually improved it after I had previously used baby shampoo.

You should run your brushes into the solution with the spinner at least twice, changing the bowl in between, so you can make sure they are actually getting clean.

I\u2019m not really sure what this product is supposed to do but for me it felt moisturizing (I live in a hot tropical climate and most true moisturizers leave my face looking oily), cleared up nose breakout, evened out texture, kept oil under control, and even made my blackheads WAY less prominent. It\u2019s got a gooey almost sticky consistency that spreads very smoothly over the face and dries to nothing, I use it before applying my retinoid at night and add a layer after.

This mascara provides length and volume with a good wand to separate lashes. It dries to a soft, feathery texture. This stuff stays put! It has stood the test of rubbing, itchy/watering eyes from allergy symptoms, crying, running through rain, sleeping in make up \u2014 all without smudging, flaking or clumping. This version doesn't claim to be waterproof, though water and my regular cleanser are not enough, I have to use eye makeup remover to clean it off thoroughly.\" \u2014Lindsey M.\u00a0",

      "Promising review: \"I always found when taking off my mascara my lashes are hard, and the mascara flakes off when I take it off using makeup remover wipes. However, ever since I started using primer, I no longer had this problem. This primer is easy to apply; it's very soft and it's a white color, which I like because you actually can see where on your lashes an extension is happening. This primer also makes my lashes longer, and prevents them from clumping. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\"\u00a0\u2014the queen",

Sunday's was the first big win for Broncos head coach Sean Payton and a much-needed victory for Russ. Travis Kelce's production was down, which some blame on the absence of girlfriend Taylor Swift.

The division dominated by Aaron Rodgers for so long now belongs to Jared Goff and the Lions.\u00a0 Fueled by Dan Campbell and a defense you'd hate to be on the other side of, the Lions rebuild is in full effect.\u00a0 Do the Lions have what it takes to go all the way to the Super Bowl? That remains to be seen, but we're going to have fun watching them try.",
      "Taylor Swift is the only thing bigger than the NFL: Taylor and Travis officially made it official this past weekend, hard launching their romance with surprise cameos on SNL and a public moment of PDA that sent Swifties and the Chiefs Kingdom swooning. As if fans weren't already on the Chiefs bandwagon, Swift has made fans of entire universe of 12-year-old girls. If they weren't already tuning in, they are now. With booming ratings, windbreaker sales galore and Taylor spotting at Arrowhead Stadium, Taylor Swift has proved that the only thing bigger than the NFL is her.",
      "That 49ers defense is dangerous:\u00a0Brock Purdy silenced naysayers last season when he took over after both QBs Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo suffered season-ending injuries. Coach Shanahan traded Lance and gave Purdy the starting job this season with little trepidation that the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft had what it takes. Shanahan's decision has paid off two weeks in, the team is undefeated and Purdy shows full command of the team. But the 49ers Nick Bosa-led defense is what could take this team to the Super Bowl. The Niners come into Week 7 with just loss. If this team can stay healthy, they have the makings of a Super Bowl contender and one of \u00a0the most fun teams to watch this season.",

With booming ratings, windbreaker sales galore and Taylor spotting at Arrowhead Stadium, Taylor Swift has proved that the only thing bigger than the NFL is her.",
      "That 49ers defense is dangerous:\u00a0Brock Purdy silenced naysayers last season when he took over after both QBs Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo suffered season-ending injuries. Coach Shanahan traded Lance and gave Purdy the starting job this season with little trepidation that the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft had what it takes. Shanahan's decision has paid off two weeks in, the team is undefeated and Purdy shows full command of the team. But the 49ers Nick Bosa-led defense is what could take this team to the Super Bowl. The Niners come into Week 7 with just loss. If this team can stay healthy, they have the makings of a Super Bowl contender and one of \u00a0the most fun teams to watch this season.",

Even without Metcalf on the field, this surging Seahawks team is going to make it anything but easy for the Cardinals to score their second win of the 2023 NFL season.\u00a0",

The division dominated by Aaron Rodgers for so long now belongs to Jared Goff and the Lions.\u00a0 Fueled by Dan Campbell and a defense you'd hate to be on the other side of, the Lions rebuild is in full effect.\u00a0 Do the Lions have what it takes to go all the way to the Super Bowl? That remains to be seen, but we're going to have fun watching them try. If there ever was an NFL underdog we're rooting for, it would be this team.",

As if fans weren't already on the Chiefs bandwagon, Swift has made fans of entire universe of 12-year-old girls. If they weren't already tuning in, they are now. With booming ratings, windbreaker sales galore and Taylor spotting at Arrowhead Stadium, Taylor Swift has proved that the only thing bigger than the NFL is her.",
      "That 49ers defense is dangerous:\u00a0Brock Purdy silenced naysayers last season when he took over after both QBs Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo suffered season-ending injuries. Coach Shanahan traded Lance and gave Purdy the starting job this season with little trepidation that the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft had what it takes. Shanahan's decision has paid off two weeks in, the team is undefeated and Purdy shows full command of the team. But the 49ers Nick Bosa-led defense is what could take this team to the Super Bowl. The Niners come into Week 7 with just loss. If this team can stay healthy, they have the makings of a Super Bowl contender and one of \u00a0the most fun teams to watch this season.",

Coming into Week 7, Love is facing backlash from fans critical of lackluster performances and interceptions that followed the Utah State alum's strong season start.",
      "The Broncos are 1-5 this season and Broncos fans' calls to bench Russ are just as loud as the Pack's criticism of Love. Both QBs have been here before, both well-versed at finding the grace in the pressure. But while the criticism gets louder, one team will leave with a victory. The other will have to continue to face the music.\u00a0",
      "Note: CBS Essentials and Paramount+ are both subsidiaries of Paramount.",
      "The Week 7 game between the Packers and the Broncos will be played Sunday, Oct. 22 at 4:25 p.m. ET (1:25 p.m. PT). The game will air on CBS and stream on Paramount+.",

As if fans weren't already on the Chiefs bandwagon, Swift has made fans of entire universe of 12-year-old girls. If they weren't already tuning in, they are now. With booming ratings, windbreaker sales galore and Taylor spotting at Arrowhead Stadium, Taylor Swift has proved that the only thing bigger than the NFL is her.",
      "That 49ers defense is dangerous:\u00a0Brock Purdy silenced naysayers last season when he took over after both QBs Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo suffered season-ending injuries. Coach Shanahan traded Lance and gave Purdy the starting job this season with little trepidation that the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft had what it takes. Shanahan's decision has paid off two weeks in, the team is undefeated and Purdy shows full command of the team. But the 49ers Nick Bosa-led defense is what could take this team to the Super Bowl. The Niners come into Week 7 with just loss. If this team can stay healthy, they have the makings of a Super Bowl contender and one of \u00a0the most fun teams to watch this season.",

If you're tuning in to see just how hard the Bills flex on their AFC rival, read on. Likewise, if you're an underdog-enthusiast (raises hand) this game has the Pats coming in a major underdog, which means anything can happen.\u00a0 We can't wait to watch.",

The division dominated by Aaron Rodgers for so long now belongs to Jared Goff and the Lions.\u00a0 Fueled by Dan Campbell and a defense you'd hate to be on the other side of, the Lions rebuild is in full effect.\u00a0 Do the Lions have what it takes to go all the way to the Super Bowl?

As if fans weren't already on the Chiefs bandwagon, Swift has made fans of entire universe of 12-year-old girls. If they weren't already tuning in, they are now. With booming ratings, windbreaker sales galore and Taylor spotting at Arrowhead Stadium, Taylor Swift has proved that the only thing bigger than the NFL is her.",
      "That 49ers defense is dangerous:\u00a0Brock Purdy silenced naysayers last season when he took over after both QBs Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo suffered season-ending injuries. Coach Shanahan traded Lance and gave Purdy the starting job this season with little trepidation that the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft had what it takes. Shanahan's decision has paid off two weeks in, the team is undefeated and Purdy shows full command of the team. But the 49ers Nick Bosa-led defense is what could take this team to the Super Bowl. The Niners come into Week 7 with just loss. If this team can stay healthy, they have the makings of a Super Bowl contender and one of \u00a0the most fun teams to watch this season.",

The Niners come into Week 7 with just loss. If this team can stay healthy, they have the makings of a Super Bowl contender and one of \u00a0the most fun teams to watch this season.",

The division dominated by Aaron Rodgers for so long now belongs to Jared Goff and the Lions.\u00a0 Fueled by Dan Campbell and a defense you'd hate to be on the other side of, the Lions rebuild is in full effect.\u00a0 Do the Lions have what it takes to go all the way to the Super Bowl? That remains to be seen, but we're going to have fun watching them try. If there ever was an NFL underdog we're rooting for, it would be this team.",

As if fans weren't already on the Chiefs bandwagon, Swift has made fans of entire universe of 12-year-old girls. If they weren't already tuning in, they are now. With booming ratings, windbreaker sales galore and Taylor spotting at Arrowhead Stadium, Taylor Swift has proved that the only thing bigger than the NFL is her.",
      "That 49ers defense is dangerous:\u00a0Brock Purdy silenced naysayers last season when he took over after both QBs Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo suffered season-ending injuries. Coach Shanahan traded Lance and gave Purdy the starting job this season with little trepidation that the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft had what it takes. Shanahan's decision has paid off two weeks in, the team is undefeated and Purdy shows full command of the team. But the 49ers Nick Bosa-led defense is what could take this team to the Super Bowl. The Niners come into Week 7 with just loss. If this team can stay healthy, they have the makings of a Super Bowl contender and one of \u00a0the most fun teams to watch this season.",

The team remained undefeated until back-to-back losses in Weeks 6 and 7. Deebo, Christian McCaffrey and George Kittle have battled injuries all season, but Shanahan is going to need them in the game if he wants to keep Niners fans from pivoting from Team Purdy to another team.",

The Patriots have historically struggled against the Dolphins -- Fins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa comes into the game 5-0 against Bill Belichick and the Patriots. But Week 7 was full of surprises, including the Dolphins' 17-31 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. The Dolphins may be favored to win this game, but the Pats showed last week they have what it takes.",
      "The matchup between the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins will be played Sunday, Oct. 29 at 1:00 p.m. ET (10:00 a.m. PT). It will air on CBS and stream live on Paramount+.",

Coach Shanahan traded Lance and gave Purdy the starting job this season with little trepidation that the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft had what it takes. The team remained undefeated until back-to-back losses in Weeks 6 and 7. Deebo, Christian McCaffrey and George Kittle have battled injuries all season, but Shanahan is going to need them in the game if he wants to keep Niners fans from pivoting from Team Purdy to another team.",

      "A hearing on the use of the Constitution's \"insurrection\" clause to bar former President Trump from running for president again is underway in Colorado, and oral arguments before the Minnesota Supreme Court in a similar case are scheduled for Thursday.\u00a0",
      "In Colorado, the judge rejected a motion by Trump's lawyers that she step aside because she once contributed money to a liberal group.",
      "The cases both invoke what's known as the disqualification clause, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, and the provision has now been cited in the two lawsuits brought by voters in Colorado and Minnesota who argue Trump is constitutionally ineligible to hold federal office because of his actions surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "The suits aimed at the former president set up what are sure to be closely watched legal battles that will test the reach and force of a constitutional provision enacted in the wake of the Civil War, and the outcomes could upend the Republican primary if Trump, currently the leading candidate for the GOP nomination, is found to be ineligible to seek the White House for a third time.",
      "Section 3 of the 14th Amendment\u00a0states:",
      "No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.",
      "\"We've had hearings with presidential candidates debating their eligibility before \u2014 Barack Obama, Ted Cruz, John McCain,\" said Derek T. Muller, a Notre Dame law professor, listing candidates challenged on whether they met the constitutional requirement of being a \"natural born citizen.\" But these cases, Muller added, are different from using an obscure clause of the Constitution with the \"incendiary\" bar against insurrection.",
      "Even if they're long shots, Muller said, they have a plausible legal path to success and raise important issues.",
      "\"Those legal questions are very heavy ones,\" Muller said.",
      "Dozens of cases citing Section 3 of the 14th Amendment have been filed in recent months, but the ones in Colorado and Minnesota seem the most important, according to legal experts, because they were filed by two liberal groups with significant legal resources. They also targeted states with clear, swift processes for challenges to candidates' ballot qualifications.",
      "The plaintiffs in the cases argue the issue is simple: Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, leading to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, disqualify him from the presidency just as clearly as if he were not a natural-born citizen, another constitutional prerequisite for the office.",
      "\"Four years after taking an oath to 'preserve, protect and defend' the Constitution as President of the United States ... Trump tried to overthrow the results of the 2020 election, leading to a violent insurrection at the United States Capitol to stop the lawful transfer of power to his successor,\" the Colorado lawsuit alleges, filed on behalf of Republican and unaffiliated voters by the liberal group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.",
      "\"By instigating this unprecedented assault on the American constitutional order, Trump violated his oath and disqualified himself under the Fourteenth Amendment from holding public office, including the Office of the President.\"",
      "Trump has derided the lawsuits as \"election interference.\" His lawyers contend that none of the issues are simple in a provision of the Constitution that hasn't been used in 150 years.",
      "\"This is a legal Hail Mary by the Democrats,\" said Mike Davis, an attorney who appeared with representatives of the Trump campaign outside court Monday in Denver before the Colorado trial began. \"This case is going to fail.\" ",
      "Trump's campaign said it had filed a motion for the judge in the case, Sarah B. Wallace, to recuse herself because she had made a $100 donation to the liberal group Colorado Turnout Project in October 2022.",
      "She was appointed to the bench in August of that year by Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat. Wallace denied the motion, saying she didn't recall the donation until the motion was filed and has no preconceptions about the legal issues in the case.",
      "\"I will not allow this legal proceeding to turn into a circus,\" she said as the hearing began.",
      "The clause in the 14th Amendment has only been used a handful of times since immediately after the Civil War. Trump's lawyers contend that it was never meant to apply to the office of president, which is not mentioned in the text, unlike \"Senator or Representative in Congress\" and \"elector of President and Vice President.\"",
      "The provision allows Congress to grant amnesty \u2014 as was done in 1872 to allow former confederates back into government \u2014 which has led some to argue that it has no power without an enabling act of Congress.",
      "Finally, Trump's lawyers contend the former president never \"engaged in insurrection\" and was simply exercising his free speech rights to warn about election results he did not believe were legitimate. ",
      "\"Trump's comments did not come close to 'incitement,' let alone 'engagement' in an insurrection,\" his attorneys wrote in a filing in the Colorado case, adding examples of cases where the congressional authors of Section Three declined to use it against people who only rhetorically backed the confederacy.",
      "The arguments in Colorado could feature testimony from witnesses to the Jan. 6 attack or other important events during Trump's efforts to overturn the election. The identities of witnesses have been shielded until they take the stand, part of the court's effort to limit the heated rhetoric and threats that have become an issue in Trump's criminal trials.",
      "The lawyers are expected to delve deeply into the history of the drafting of the provision in the 14th Amendment and its use between its adoption in 1868 and the amnesty law in 1872. There is scant legal precedent on the issue \u2014 so little that the attorneys have had to argue about the meaning of an 1869 case written by Salmon Chase, who was then chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court but wrote only as an appeals judge.",
      "After the amnesty act in 1872, legal scholars could only find one other time the provision was cited, when Congress refused to seat a socialist member of the House of Representatives because he opposed entry into World War I. ",
      "Then last year, it was used by CREW to bar the head of \"Cowboys for Trump\" from a county commission seat in rural New Mexico. A second liberal group, Free Speech For People, filed lawsuits seeking to prevent Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor-Greene and Madison Cawthorn from running for reelection.",
      "The judge overseeing Greene's case ruled in her favor, while Cawthorn's case became moot after he was defeated in his primary. Free Speech For People filed the case in Minnesota, where challenges to ballot appearances go straight to the state supreme court.",

      "It hardly mattered that \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d was released simultaneously in theaters and on streaming this weekend. Fans flocked to movie theaters across the country to see the scary video game adaptation on the big screen, which made $78 million to top the North American box office, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Universal Pictures bet on a day-and-date release on the weekend before Halloween, sending it to 3,675 theaters in the U.S. and Canada, while also making it available for Peacock subscribers, the subscription streaming service owned by NBCUniversal. The movie also opened in 64 markets internationally, where it\u2019s expected to gross $52.6 million, giving the film a $130.6 million global launch \u2013 the biggest of any horror released this year.",
      "Blumhouse, the company behind \u201cParanormal Activity,\u201d \u201cGet Out\u201d and recent horror hits like \u201cM3GAN\u201d and \u201cThe Black Phone,\u201d produced \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s,\u201d which was directed by Emma Tammi and stars Josh Hutcherson, Mary Stuart Masterson and Matthew Lillard. The popular video game series, in which a security guard has to fend off murderous animatronic characters at a run down family pizza restaurant, Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza, was created by Scott Cawthon and first released in 2014.",
      "While the game\u2019s fanbase was strong, and passionate, the movie took many years to make. Producer Jason Blum said in an interview with IGN earlier this year that he was made fun of for pursuing an adaptation.",
      "\u201cEveryone said we could never get the movie done, including, by the way, internally in my company,\u201d Blum said. They made the film with a reported $20 million production budget.",
      "And it paid off: \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d is his company\u2019s biggest opening of all time, surpassing \u201cHalloween\u2019s\u201d domestic and global debut. The opening weekend audience was very young, with an estimated 80% under the age of 25, and predominately male (58%). They gave the film an A- CinemaScore, which could be promising for future weekends.",
      "\u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d did not score well with critics, however. It currently has a dismal 25% on Rotten Tomatoes.\u00a0AP\u2019s Mark Kennedy wrote\u00a0that it \u201chas to go down as one of the poorest films in any genre this year.\u201d But like many other horror movies, it appears to be critic-proof.",
      "Further down the charts, \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d is expected to cross $200 million in global grosses by the end of Sunday, having added $14.7 million domestically and $6.7 million internationally this weekend. The concert film, distributed by AMC Theatres, is in its third weekend in theaters where it is only playing from Thursday through Sunday, though there will be \u201cspecial Halloween showtimes\u201d on Tuesday at a discounted price of $13.13.",
      "Martin Scorsese\u2019s\u00a0\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d also added $9 million in its second weekend, bringing its total domestic earnings to $40.7 million, according to Paramount.",
      "Several of the fall\u2019s high-profile films also launched in very limited release this weekend, including\u00a0Alexander Payne\u2019s \u201cThe Holdovers\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0Sofia Coppola\u2019s \u201cPriscilla.\u201d Both opened exclusively in New York and Los Angeles and will expand in the coming weeks.",
      "Focus Features\u2019 \u201cThe Holdovers,\u201d starring Paul Giamatti as a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher at a New England prep school, debuted in six theaters where it earned an estimated $200,000.",
      "Coppola\u2019s \u201cPriscilla,\u201d about Priscilla Presley\u2019s life with Elvis, also opened on four screens in New York and Los Angeles, where it averaged $33,035 per screen.

    "paragraphs": [
      "Americans continued their revenge spending in the third quarter despite persistent inflation and rising interest rates, helping the U.S. economy grow at its fastest pace since late 2021.",
      "Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 4.9% annual rate last quarter, according to the so-called advance estimate that the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported Thursday. That\u2019s up from just 2.1% in the second quarter. The latest figure was buoyed by rising federal and state government spending, increased exports, and inventory investments from businesses, the BEA explained.",
      "The Biden administration was quick to celebrate the surge in U.S. economic growth after years of consistent recession predictions from Wall Street. Ever since inflation surged to a four-decade high of over 9% in June 2022, a chorus of experts has repeatedly warned that the Federal Reserve may need to hike interest rates until the economy slips into recession if it truly wants to restore price stability for consumers. But President Biden rebuked that thinking on Thursday.",
      "\u201cI never believed we would need a recession to bring inflation down\u2014and today we saw again that the American economy continues to grow even as inflation has come down,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt is a testament to the resilience of American consumers and American workers, supported by Bidenomics\u2014my plan to grow the economy by growing the middle class.\u201d",
      "The latest surge in GDP surprised many economists and Wall Street analysts who still fear rising interest rates and stubborn inflation could spark a recession. Some even argued Thursday the latest GDP report was merely the last hurrah of a slowing economy.",
      "\u201cTake a good look at the estimate for third-quarter GDP because it could be the highest that we see for a while,\u201d Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate, said.\u00a0",
      "Hamrick noted the economy still faces \u201csubstantial headwinds,\u201d including the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201chigher for longer\u201d interest rate policy, surging Treasury yields, and the potential for a partial federal government shutdown in November due to gridlock in Washington over the federal budget. On top of that, the threat of geopolitical instability is rising as the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts continue.",
      "\u201cExpectations are muted for the intermediate term amid no shortage of sources of uncertainty,\u201d Hamrick said of the economy. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that recent substantial momentum can be sustained.\u201d",
      "Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economics at Fitch Ratings, argued the GDP numbers were evidence that economic growth \u201ctransitioned from resilience to reacceleration\u201d in the third quarter, defying the Fed\u2019s aggressive interest rate hikes. But she warned that the economy\u2019s current strength won\u2019t make the Fed\u2019s inflation-fighting job any easier, and Chair Jerome Powell is likely to end the economic-growth winning streak soon by raising rates and keeping them elevated.",
      "\u201cThe Fed\u2019s higher for longer message may turn out to be much higher for much longer,\u201d she warned. \u201cThe bottom line is that the staying power of this growth spurt is questionable going forward; above-trend economic growth cannot sustainably coexist alongside an increasingly restrictive interest rate environment.\u201d",
      "A number of economists were quick to share words of warning after the GDP report on Thursday, despite its strength. Even though consumer spending rose at a 4% annual rate last quarter, marking the largest increase since the fourth quarter of 2021, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, argued that it\u2019s a last gasp from consumers. \u201cThe real question is if the trend can continue in the coming quarters, and we think not,\u201d he said.",
      "Americans headed to Taylor Swift concerts and movies like Barbie and Oppenheimer in droves this summer, supported by the strong labor market and excess savings built up during the pandemic. But as those savings run dry and the labor market cools under the weight of rising interest rates, Roach believes that consumers will \u201cwind down their spending splurge.\u201d\u00a0",
      "He also noted that corporate investment for equipment shrank in the third quarter, evidence that rising rates have \u201cput a strain on businesses.\u201d And he explained that the third-quarter GDP numbers were boosted 1.3 percentage points by businesses rebuilding their inventories\u2014a trend that is unlikely to continue \u201cgiven the nature of inventory management.\u201d",
      "Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner backed up those comments in a Thursday note, arguing that GDP growth will slow in the coming quarters owing to a \u201cdrag from inventory drawdown\u201d after the third-quarter numbers were given a \u201cboost\u201d from inventory rebuilding. Her team is currently tracking fourth-quarter GDP at just 0.7%.",
      "\u201cWe expect to see significant slowing into the end of the year, with the cumulative effect of tighter monetary policy and tightening financial conditions,\u201d Zentner wrote.",
      "EY chief economist Gregory Daco also fears the good times won\u2019t last after the strong third-quarter GDP report.",
      "\u201cWhile these signs of economic strength will fuel speculations that the economy is reaccelerating, we do not expect such strong momentum will be sustained,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cCost fatigue, rising debt servicing costs, and slowing job growth are about to be felt more widely by consumers and businesses.\u201d",
      "Still, not every expert was bearish. Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said the third-quarter GDP report shows that rising interest rates may not be as deadly for the economy, or stocks, as previously anticipated.\u00a0",
      "\u201cInvestors think ZIRP [zero interest rate policy] is the only condition which permits the economy to grow, and that is clearly an incorrect assumption,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the U.S. so far, interest rates have accomplished the objective of stifling inflation, but not at the expense of economic growth or employment.\u201d",

All are off-limits to the actors and creatives taking part in the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) strikes that have ground Hollywood to a halt this year, with stars urged not to give studios any free promotion while negotiations are ongoing. ",
      "Halloween is traditionally a period when celebrities go viral for their outfits, with parties held by the likes of pop star Taylor Swift and supermodel Heidi Klum drawing global attention. ",
      "However, with the holiday fast approaching, SAG-AFTRA wants to ensure none of its high-profile members inadvertently promote certain content by dressing up as characters Hollywood studios own the rights to. ",
      "Members of the union are currently prohibited from promoting any new movies or TV shows, which has led to stars boycotting or walking out of premieres of their latest blockbusters. ",
      "In a \u201cHalloween Guidance\u201d post published by SAG-AFTRA this week, the union said: \u201cThis Halloween, we wanted to make sure our members don\u2019t inadvertently break strike rules, and have put together some quick tips on the dos and don\u2019ts for costumes.\u201d",
      "Members were encouraged to \u201cchoose costumes inspired by generalized charactersand figures (ghost, zombie, spider, etc.)\u201d\u2014meaning that dressing up as a spider gets the green light, but going as Sony-owned Spider-Man probably won\u2019t. ",
      "\u201cDress up as characters from non-struck content, like an animated TV show,\u201d the guidance continued. ",
      "If members really can\u2019t resist dressing up as characters from major studio-backed films or television series, SAG-AFTRA instructed them not to post any photos of their costumes to social media. ",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s use our collective power to send a loud and clear message to our struck employers that we will not promote their content without a fair contract,\u201d the guidance said. ",
      "Tensions between talent and studios began with the Hollywood Writers Guild of America (WGA) going on strike in May. Screenwriters refused to work for five months until they secured a three-year contract securing their pay, terms of streaming agreements, and assurances around the use of AI. ",
      "During that time SAG-AFTRA also announced its members would be striking, with famous faces including Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe, Breaking Bad lead Bryan Cranston, and Academy Award winner Jessica Chastain joining the picket lines. ",
      "Actors\u2019 union SAG-AFTRA, which has around 160,000 members, is striking over issues similar to those of its writer peers: pay, working conditions, and\u00a0concerns relating to the use of AI in the film industry. Actor Aaron Paul revealed that despite Breaking Bad\u2019s huge success on Netflix, he doesn\u2019t see a penny of the revenue.",
      "Negotiations between the Guild and the\u00a0Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\u00a0(AMPTP) are still ongoing, with A-listers including George Clooney, Ben Affleck, and Scarlett Johansson reportedly making a $150 million offer this week to help bring the strike to an end. ",
      "A spokesperson for Clooney confirmed to Reuters that the $150 million offer\u2014to be spread over three years\u2014would be used to fund improved health benefits for SAG-AFTRA members. ",
      "However, although SAG-AFTRA labeled it a \u201cgenerous concept\u2026worthy of consideration,\u201d it suggested the plan would not address the fundamental disagreement between the parties. ",
      "\u201cIt is in no way related to and would have no bearing on this present contract or even as a subject of collective bargaining,\u201d the organization said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cIt is, in fact, prohibited by federal labor law.\u201d",
      "Contract talks between the Hollywood union and studios broke down last week.",
      "AMPTP, which represents Netflix and Disney as well as a host of other major studios, said in a statement on Oct. 11: \u201cAfter meaningful conversations, it is clear that the gap between the AMPTP and SAG-AFTRA is too great, and conversations are no longer moving us in a productive direction.\u201d",
      "A week later, SAG-AFTRA accused AMPTP of attempting to \u201csow division\u201d among members by \u201cmisrepresenting our proposals and trying to manipulate public sentiment.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur call is simple. AMPTP, it\u2019s time to negotiate genuinely, valuing our contributions and solidifying an industry that champions everyone within it,\u201d the union said. \u201cWe subsidized the growth of the streaming model with reduced rates and low to nonexistent residuals.

      "Nostalgia and curiosity peaked moviegoer interest this summer\u2014and theaters, which were plagued during the pandemic, saw a major revival. In fact, AMC Theatres reported its best quarterly earnings in its 103-year history this week, largely thanks to the mass attendance at the Barbie and Oppenheimer movies, which had box office sales of $1.4 billion and $947 million, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "AMC, the largest movie chain in the world, posted $1.4 billion in total revenue for the third quarter, up more than 45% year-over-year.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "\u201cAMC was literally in a different ballpark of accomplishment than many third-party observers anticipated,\u201d Adam Aron, AMC chairman, president, and CEO, said during the Leawood, Kansas-based Fortune 100 company\u2019s third-quarter earnings report on Wednesday. \u201cThe entire quarter was rejuvenating for AMC. Moviegoers returned to AMC theaters and ever increasing numbers in the third quarter of 2023 in response to both our studio partners\u2019 efforts to increase the quantity and quality of new releases.\u201d",
      "But it wasn\u2019t just \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d that made the third quarter a blockbuster for AMC. Building up cash reserves and shedding unsuccessful locations helped the mega movie theater chain continue its pandemic recovery.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been maniacal in building up our cash reserves,\u201d Aron said. \u201cFor those trying to understand how AMC successfully has been defying gravity these past three and a half years: Having ample cash on hand is the secret sauce.\u201d",
      "Plus, during the third quarter, AMC added one new theater for every three it closed. That brings the total number of locations closed since the pandemic began to 156 and total new locations opened to 57. This nets a reduction of 99 locations.\u00a0",
      "However, third-quarter rents were 5.6% below the same period in 2019, Sean Goodman, AMC executive vice president of international operations and chief financial officer, said during the earnings call. AMC did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comments on how many lease negotiations were underway and how much the company had saved as a result. However, Aron said during the earnings call that the company had \u201crenegotiated our rents downwards to the tune of tens of millions of dollars of benefits a year.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis portfolio rationalization together with ongoing landlord negotiation has unequivocally resulted in a more profitable theater portfolio,\u201d he added.\u00a0",
      "The company still has a deferred rent balance of $74.2 million as of the end of the third quarter, Goodman said, but AMC plans to reduce it by another $20 million by year\u2019s end.",
      "\u201cWe had to get more efficient because during the ravages of the pandemic. We had no revenues,\u201d Aron said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten this company to be much leaner than it ever was before.\u201d",
      "With thinning margins, many movie theater chains have started adding more to the experience to attract consumers, like heated lounge chairs, new screens, and specialty foods.\u00a0",
      "Plus, the new Taylor Swift movie has been a smash hit and is helping to revive theaters and malls\u2014both commercial real estate mainstays that tanked during the pandemic. In fact, The Eras Tour helped AMC notch its highest single-day ticket revenue ever at more than $100 million within 24 hours of tickets to the film going on sale.\u00a0",
      "Other theaters, however, couldn\u2019t stay above water and have been flipped for retail and other mixed-use developments.\u00a0",
      "Plus, there is the continuing tension between theaters and streaming platforms. But the Barbenheimer craze brought millions back to theaters. In fact, a July report by the National Association of Theatre Owners showed that more than 200,000 people purchased tickets to see Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day during opening weekend alone.",
      "\u201cIn the eyes of consumers, a strong theatrical release backed up by a big marketing campaign creates value when they are picking what to watch wherever they end up watching the movie,\u201d Jackie Brenneman, president of The Cinema Foundation, wrote in the 2023 State of the Cinema Industry report. \u201cWhen the movies are there, the audiences are there.\u201d",

      "Taylor Swift\u2019s reimagined \"1989\" is here, the album that ushered in the first Peak Swift era \u2014 revisited at the height of her massive pop culture dominance.",
      "Released in 2014 and named for her birth year, the original \"1989\" signified a sonic rebirth. Swift had shed the Nashville country roots of her first four studio albums and announced herself a full-fledged pop superstar.",
      "\"1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\" out Friday, takes that version of Swift \u2014 then in her mid-20s, living in New York, prepared to take on the world with an arsenal of \u201980s synth sounds and a new producer named Jack Antonoff \u2014 and includes five unreleased \"vault\" tracks that deliver more clues about the artist she was then.",
      "TAYLOR SWIFT 'ERAS TOUR' MOVIE PREMIERE SHUTS DOWN POPULAR LOS ANGELES SHOPPING CENTER",
      "This cover image released by Republic Records shows \"1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\" by Taylor Swift. ((Republic Records via AP))",
      "WHAT IS TAYLOR SWIFT AMNESIA? SWIFTIES REPORT THEY CAN\u2019T REMEMBER HER CONCERTS FOR THIS REASON",
      "Previous \"Taylor\u2019s Version\" releases have been more than conventional rerecordings, arriving with new music, Easter eggs and visuals that deepen understanding of her work. The project \u2014 the fourth of six rereleases \u2014 was instigated by music manager Scooter Braun\u2019s purchase and sale of her early catalog and represents Swift\u2019s effort to control her own songs and how they\u2019re used.",
      "Her return to \"1989\" \u2014 the album where she began to confront media portrayals of herself and in song \u2014 comes at another Swift popularity crescendo but also during a 2010s nostalgia (Yes, it\u2019s only 2023. Yes, the nostalgia is real).",
      "Here are some key things to consider as \"1989\" propels the New Peak Swift era forward:",
      "OPENING THE VAULTListeners will dive deep into the vault tracks for clues into Swift\u2019s mind around 2014. \"Slut!\" may recall her contentious relationship with the press, which fixated on her alleged romantic relationships and the songs she\u2019d write once they ended.",
      "They\u2019ll find connections to \"Out of the Woods\" on \"Is It Over Now?\" in the lyrics \"when you lost control / red blood, white snow.\" They\u2019ll wonder who made her pretend to like acid rock and mega yachts on \"Now That We Don\u2019t Talk.\" But more insight will be found in thinking about where Swift was at the time, what came next, and how that mirrors the current moment.",
      "Swift dominated headlines and award show crowd shots in 2014, reaching a point of oversaturation, and leading to her retreat from the public eye prior to the release of her undercelebrated revenge record, 2017\u2019s \"Reputation.\" With Swift getting similar treatment on NFL broadcasts due to her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, could history repeat itself?",
      "Brittany Spanos, senior writer at Rolling Stone, puts it simply: \"People just get easily sick of anyone who\u2019s super famous. And I think that we haven\u2019t had a lot of monocultural kind of celeb moments like this in a minute,\" she says of Swift in 2023.",
      "Rebecca Jennings, a senior correspondent at Vox covering social platforms and the creator economy, sees a connection between the 2014 eras as being \"post-recession\" and 2023 being \"post-COVID,\" a time where Swift succeeds because there\u2019s a sort of cultural \"bouncing back vibe,\" a time where people want celebratory music.",
      "In 2014, that was Swift finding her pop sound with \"1989.\"",
      "In 2023, it\u2019s becoming the most successful version of herself, and rereleasing \"1989 \" while on the top of her game.",
      "TAYLOR SWIFT'S ERAS TOUR LEAVES US AFTER MONTHS OF MAKING HISTORY AND CAUSING CHAOS",
      "FROM COUNTRY TO POP: A TRANSITIONAL ALBUM\"It was a huge risk for her to move completely outside of country \u2013 there\u2019s no country elements on this album whatsoever,\" says Spanos, who also teaches a course on Swift at New York University\u2019s Clive Davis Institute. She says Swift\u2019s penchant for pop songwriting is evidenced all the way back on her 2008 sophomore release \"Fearless\" in tracks like \"Love Story,\" but \"1989\" is \"her first official, full-length pop project.\"",
      "However, more so than a declarative move into pop, Spanos views \"1989\" as \"more in the lineage of the kind of transitional albums teen stars tend to make when they move into adulthood,\" comparing it to Janet Jackson\u2019s \"Control\" and Christina Aguilera\u2019s \"Stripped.\" \"1989\" is the album where Swift\u2019s divorced herself from adolescence. She\u2019s moved to NYC; she\u2019s working with new people; she\u2019s making synth pop.",
      "Rachel Brodsky, a music and culture writer who has been covering Swift for well over a decade, points out that Swift\u2019s sonic experimentations were earned \u2014 and that she very well might be one of the final pop superstars who couldn\u2019t come out of the gate playing with genre the way listeners are accustomed to now.",
      "\"She came up in the shadow of the Chicks, where she was told under certain circumstances by her team, like, \u2019You don\u2019t want to be the Chicks,\" Brodsky says of the country music group who were chastised for going against the expectations of their audience.",
      "The Chicks, acts like Shania Twain and LeAnn Rimes cracked open the door for Swift to burst open on \"1989,\" she says. And not just as a pop musician, but as someone bucking convention \u2014 something Brodsky says artists like Kacey Musgraves, Maren Morris and even Olivia Rodrigo have followed.",
      "TICKETMASTER APOLOGIZES TO TAYLOR SWIFT, FANS OVER SALES DISASTER",
      "ENGAGING WITH HER OWN CELEBRITYBy the time \"1989\" rolled around, Swift was no longer writing high school romances and fairytale narratives.",
      "She\u2019d begun engaging with her celebrity reality \u2014 inviting Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z to her birthday party, hanging out with models and other very famous people in a group labeled \"the Squad\" in the media.",
      "She was also writing songs like \"\u2019Bad Blood,\u2019 which is about her feud with Katy Perry,\" says Spanos, a decisive move away from the kind of humility and \"hometown girl\" image associated with \"country Taylor.\" That meant occupying more space in the pop landscape: reconciling with Kanye West after the infamous 2009 VMAs moment, starring alongside Drake in a commercial, getting Kendrick Lamar on a remix, so on and so forth.",
      "In 2023, Swift is more famous now than she was then, and she's still engaging with her celebrity in a very public way.",
      "'1989 (TAYLOR\u2019S VERSION)\u2019 PLAYS INTO FONDNESS FOR 2014Jennings believes people are nostalgic for the year 2014 and always will be \u2014 because it was one of the last online periods before the hyper-commodification of social media \u2014 which makes 2023 the ideal time for revisiting \"1989.\"",
      "There were blogs, and Tumblr, and our internet lives were less defined by algorithms. \"It is looked at as this Edenic time of innocence and purity,\" she says. At the time, there was a kind of monoculture that leans itself to nostalgia in 2023, she says \u2014 everyone receiving the same information on the same topics at the same time, Taylor Swift\u2019s \"1989\" era included \u2014 as opposed to the current influencer-based model.",
      "(It\u2019s worth noting that Swift herself was very active on Tumblr, using the social media platform to find fans to invite to private listening sessions held in her home.)",
      "Additionally, in the last few months, Swift has been seen dining with very famous friends like Blake Lively, Sophie Turner and Selena Gomez, a return to the language of her \"Squad.\" \"By parading out many of the same friends she had during that era that she was also parading about, she\u2019s playing into this nostalgia element,\" argues Jennings.",
      "ROB GRONKOWSKI SAYS NFL IS OVERDOING IT WITH TAYLOR SWIFT COVERAGE DURING GAMES: \u2018WE WANT MORE FOOTBALL\u2019",
      "At the time, theories swirled around Swift\u2019s assumed romantic relationships \u2014 many believe the song \"Style\" is about her short relationship with Harry Styles \u2014 and in 2023, her latest assumed romance has become a top story again.",
      "\"It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s method promoting,\" Spanos jokes. \"She\u2019s leaning into it again.\" But there\u2019s a huge difference in the kind of treatment she\u2019s receiving from the public this time around. The press appears to be rooting for her relationship, she says, instead of thinking about the breakup songs it might inspire, warning her male partners and turning Swift into the butt of the joke \u2014 as the media was doing in 2014.",
      "\"There\u2019s a little bit less of that level of misogyny,\" Spanos says.",
      "So what\u2019s next for Swift?",
      "The continuation of her Eras tour, which is set to resume on November 9th in Buenos Aires, Argentina. And, of course, two more \"Taylor\u2019s Version\" albums.",

      "\"Because there were some people saying he\u2019s not going to be able to handle the season, he\u2019s not going to be a good football player. But it turns out that the more that he is pushed or challenged, he takes it to a new level.\"",
      "There was a group that believed Kelce\u2019s relationship with Swift would impact how he plays for the Chiefs, but the 34-year-old is enjoying quite the season thus far, even with Kansas City dropping its latest game against the Denver Broncos.\u00a0",

      "But Kelce still had a decent day with 58 yards on six catches (nine targets). The week prior, he exploded against their AFC West-rival Los Angeles Chargers, totaling 179 yards (second-most of his career) on 12 catches with a touchdown.\u00a0",

He\u2019s done so while also dealing with injuries, including a knee bone bruise that led to him missing Week 1\u2019s opener against the Detroit Lions.\u00a0",
      "Kelce admitted it\u2019s been taking some getting used to with the extra media attention. He should also be aware that his fans have skyrocketed due to the relationship, too, as \"Swifties\" collectively want Kelce to perform well each week.\u00a0",

      "The All-Pro Chiefs tight end joked with his brother, Eagles center Jason Kelce, on their podcast last week that seeing their father Ed Kelce interact with Swift was \"terrifying.\" But while we still don't know exactly what Swift thinks of the elder Kelce, it appears Ed has officially become a Swiftie.",
      "In an interview with People magazine, Ed described Swift as \"a very, very sweet, very charming, down-to-earth young woman. \u2026 Very genuine.\"",
      "It appears Swift made a great first impression on Ed the first time they met in Travis' designated friends and family suit at Arrowhead Stadium, likely during the Chiefs win over the Broncos on Oct. 12.",
      "\"We're sitting in the suite, she gets up to go get a drink or something and she starts picking up empty bottles, cans, plates that are scattered around,\" Ed said. \"Because in the suites everybody gets stuff and you empty it down wherever you can. And I'm just thinking, I don't think she got the diva memo. She didn't get the spoiled musician. She doesn't know how to pull that off. And that really to me said a whole lot. \u2026 She's very smart. I mean, very. That comes through right away.\"",
      "Swift was also seen helping clean up the suite after the Chiefs' blowout win over the Chicago Bears in September, the first game she attended after rumors romantically linking her and Travis began to surface.",
      "Ed is far from the only high-profile Chiefs family member to come away impressed after interacting with Swift, who has also spent ample time with Ed's ex-wife and Travis and Jason's mother Donna. Swift has become acquainted with Brittany Mahomes, wife of star Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, to the point where the two have a special handshake.\u00a0",
      "Additionally, Mahomes' mother Randi posted a picture on Instagram of Swift with her arm around Patrick's younger sister Mia at the game, noting how \"sweet\" Swift was to her daughter.",
      "On the field, meanwhile, it's hard to argue with the results. The Chiefs are undefeated and 4-1 against the spread since Swift began attending their games, with Travis himself averaging 99.8 receiving yards per game in that time frame.\u00a0",
      "[Travis Kelce dazzled in Week 7. Is he 'showing off' for Taylor Swift?]",

      "\"If I'm [Chiefs owners] the Hunt family, I'd give her a suite,\" Cowherd said. \"I would give her season tickets. You've got to get her in the building. You're gonna need Taylor Swift in the playoffs.\"",

      "In perhaps the most obvious public confirmation of their relationship since rumors of it first surfaced back in September, Taylor Swift changed the lyrics to one of her songs to refer to Travis Kelce and then embraced him when coming off the stage during a concert Saturday in the first international leg of her \"Eras Tour.\"",
      "With the Chiefs on their bye week, Kelce flew to Argentina with Swift and her father and took in the concert next to Scott Swift, who was wearing a Chiefs lanyard. When Taylor debuted a tweak to the lyrics of her hit song \"Karma\" to reference \"that guy on the Chiefs,\" Scott gave Kelce a playful shove and put his hands up as Kelce covered his face in glee.",
      "Kelce had \"a little bit of a clue\" that Swift would give him a shout-out from the stage, but he said on the latest episode of the \"New Heights\" podcast he co-hosts with his brother, Jason Kelce, that the lyric change still \"shocked\" him.",
      "\"I was like, \u2018Oh s---, she really just said that,\u2019\" Travis said. \"All right.\"",
      "Jason teased his brother about leaving Scott Swift hanging after Taylor sang the line. Travis profusely apologized to his girlfriend's father \u2014 and revealed that he may have convinced Scott, a fan of Jason's Eagles like Taylor was, to join \"Chiefs Kingdom.\"",
      "\"Got him over here to the good side, baby,\" Travis said. \"One by one, getting all the good ones. Come on over, man. \u2026 I might have persuaded him at dinner the night before when I met him. He's a huge football guy.\"",
      "Though Jason was intrigued after Travis said he thinks Scott Swift once played center \u2014 Jason's position \u2014 at the University of Delaware, he also got in some ribbing regarding the supposed fandom change.",
      "\"You're gonna let this man's devilishly good looks and relationship with your daughter sway you from a lifetime of fandom, Scott?\" Jason joked. \"This is ridiculous.\"",
      "Other videos and photos posted to social media Saturday night showed Kelce and Scott Swift engaged in conversation throughout the evening.\u00a0",
      "But the most viral moment came when Taylor left the stage during an intermission \u2014 and ran straight into Travis' arms near the stage, in full view of several hundred concert attendees. The two shared a kiss and long embrace.",
      "According to The Messenger, which first broke the news of Kelce and Taylor Swift \"quietly hanging out\" in September, the two are \"fully dating\" in a \"serious\" relationship.\u00a0",
      "\"I was enjoying myself down there,\" Travis said on his podcast. \"The show was even more electric knowing I had even more to enjoy it for. Taylor absolutely ripped it. She killed it.\"",
      "Despite the ribbing, Jason made it clear he is thrilled about how happy his brother looked in the videos.\u00a0",
      "\"It was a lot of fun watching it through social media,\" Jason said. \"It's a lot of fun seeing the look on your face. I'm glad that you enjoyed it.\"",
      "Swift has attended four Chiefs games this season and hosted a watch party for other players' significant others \u2014 including Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany \u2014 when Kansas City played the Dolphins in Germany in Week 9. Cameras at the games Swift has attended have shown her chatting with Kelce's parents Donna and Ed as well.",
      "According to sports social media agency bknown, which has tracked Kelce's rapid social media follower growth since he and Swift first started appearing together, Kelce gained 83,700 new Instagram followers on Sunday as the videos of him and Swift at her concert went viral. That is the most he has gained in a single day since Oct. 2, when Swift attended the Chiefs' road win against the New York Jets.",
      "Swift will still be touring in South America when the Chiefs return from their bye to play the Eagles on Monday, so it's unclear if she will attend the game, which is a special one. Travis faces off against Jason for the first time since the Chiefs defeated the Eagles in last year's Super Bowl.",

      "Some football fans speculated that the outside noise surrounding the Kelce-Swift rumored romance would be a distraction for the reigning Super Bowl champions, but it appears to have had the opposite effect. Co-host Keyshawn Johnson said this is because Kelce, one of the league's most valuable playmakers, was already a superstar before they met.",
      "\"The great thing for this team is that they're still on course \u2026 to making yet another AFC Championship Game appearance at home \u2014 that would be six in a row \u2014 and possibly another Super Bowl appearance,\" Johnson added. \"I tip my hat off.\"",

Heading into Week 8, his 525 receiving yards are the 12th-most in the league among all pass-catchers but first among TEs. In fact, 18 wide receivers separate Kelce from the next closest TE, Darren Waller, who checks in at No. 31 overall (380 receiving yards).",
      "For the Chiefs specifically, Kelce boasts 220 more receiving yards than the team's top receiver, Rashee Rice (305 total yards), despite playing one fewer game. Kelce was out with a hyperextended knee in Week 1, and had four catches for 26 yards in his return in Week 2. He has caught 48 passes for 499 yards and four touchdowns in the six games since Swift first watched Kelce play on Sept. 24.\u00a0",
      "Next up for Kansas City is a road game against Denver on Sunday (4:25 p.m. ET), and fans will be keeping tabs on whether Swift will make the trip to Empower Field in what could be her last chance to see Kelce & Co. in action before she heads to South America in early November to resume the international leg of The Eras Tour and the Chiefs travel abroad to face Miami in Week 9 at Deutsche Bank Park in Germany (Nov. 5 at 9:30 a.m. ET).",

      "Of course, Travis Kelce was wrong \u2014 aka joking \u2014 when he gave his most imaginative excuse yet as to why he couldn't, or wouldn't, talk about his who-knows-what-they-are-but-let's-just-call-her-his-girlfriend, Taylor Swift.",
      "Or was he?",
      "The Kansas City Chiefs tight end was naturally cornered by reporters keen to get the scoop on his romantic status when the squad touched down in the Swiftie hotbed of Germany last week. Despite their best efforts, Kelce refused to spill any gossip about whether the recording icon would attend the game against the Miami Dolphins \u2026 (she didn't).",
      "\"When I mentioned, or everybody knows, that she's at the game \u2026 the Over-Under on my catches kind of goes up and down,\" Kelce said. \"The spread goes up and down. So, you know, I don't want to mess with any of that stuff, so I'm going to keep it to myself.\"",
      "Wow, that's an original one. But could it actually be true?",
      "Who knows where Kelce is getting his info or if he was just deflecting the scuttlebutt in a particularly imaginative fashion? Yet, as absurd as the premise sounds that the mere presence of a songstress love interest could appeal to the oddsmakers' soft side, there is at least a statistical starting point for a discussion.",
      "In the four games this season where Swift has been in the house, Kelce has lit things up for an average of 108 yards per game. On the four occasions he has played while she has been missing from her customary position next to Kelce's mom, Donna, or alongside Patrick Mahomes' wife Brittany, his mean has been just over 41 yards per, from 5.8 catches.",
      "[The NFL (Taylor\u2019s Version): Every NFL team as a Taylor Swift song]",
      "Given how sportsbooks covet detailed figures and prioritize profit, is there something cooking here?",
      "\"Sorry,\" said Thomas Gable, director of race and sports at the Borgata in Atlantic City, with a laugh. \"But even if we knew ahead of time whether she was going to be there, it is not going to affect the opening numbers on the game or on Travis Kelce's props. Those things are based on a lot of data, not based on someone who is not on the field.\"",
      "So that's that, then. Kind of. But wait \u2026",
      "\"Having said that, because of how popular and famous she is, Taylor Swift being there may influence how people bet,\" Gable added. \"If someone knows she will be at the game, and feels Kelce will play well because of it, his props may start getting bet. Bookmakers can react to a market being bet if there is a lot of money coming in.\"",
      "But what about those stats? Dealing with info that appears to reflect a certain trend, but might actually be completely coincidental, is all part of the variable nature of the sports betting industry.",
      "As fun as it would be to think that flexing for his new beau propels Kelce to superhuman feats, Gable said that in reality what has happened the past couple of months \u2014 including Kelce's 14-yard showing in the victory over Miami in Frankfurt \u2014 is well within the bounds of standard variation.",
      "Gable predicted it would hypothetically take much more, something like a full campaign's worth of Kelce shining every time Swift is watching and underperforming every time she doesn't, before the oddsmakers had viable cause for hesitation.",
      "There is actually a little more depth to this than you'd imagine was possible, and there are some gray areas involved. Because the story is an enjoyable one to anyone with a sense of fun, you never know quite what to make of what is being said about it.",
      "For example, Mahomes either admitted \u2014 or possibly it was merely a playful quip \u2014 that knowing Swift and a legion of her fans attended the Chiefs' beatdown of the Chicago Bears in late September, he'd deliberately tried to funnel the ball into Kelce's hands as much as possible.",
      "\"You can't ignore this thing, and I honestly can't understand why anyone would feel the need to get uptight about it,\" FOX Sports betting expert Chris \"The Bear\" Fallica told me. \"From a betting perspective, it is actually really interesting.",
      "\"Without any doubt, as weird as it sounds, this story can bring in new bettors. The whole demographic where the NFL probably doesn't have as much hold as others is the young female market.",
      "\"If someone gets interested because they like Taylor Swift, and then enjoy the game, and puts $20 on Kelce to score a touchdown, that's a new audience right there.\"",
      "['Swifties Effect': How Taylor Swift is affecting Travis Kelce, NFL player props]",
      "A bye week looms for the 7-2 Chiefs, so the speculation and the cameras trained on the friends-and-family seats will have to be put on ice for a minute. All of this just gives more time for bettors, experts and oddsmakers to look a little bit deeper at things, if they are so minded.",
      "The topic has already taken Fallica's reserves of dedicated football research to a whole new level. If Swift is indeed the lucky charm, then it is fair to assume Chiefs fans would want her in attendance in Las Vegas were the team to make it back to the Super Bowl. The problem is, according to Fallica's indefatigable sleuthing, she's performing on tour in Japan the night before.",
      "Is there a jet that could get her to Vegas' Allegiant Stadium on time? Is this even something worth talking about? Is the whole thing a big old coincidence or further evidence of love's mystical mysteries? Is their relationship even real?",

      "Order the teams by POINTS SCORED from highest to lowest:Rams, Cowboys, Saints, Colts",
      "There's a chance Dallas gets a non-offensive score this week, and that would be a plus for me putting them on top here. If the Colts can limit their turnovers, I think they can score on New Orleans. The Rams will be chasing points in Dallas. When it comes to New Orleans, all I can say is, well, eesh\u2026\u00a0",
      "Prediction: Cowboys, Colts, Rams, Saints",
      "Which running back will have the most RUSHING YARDS?D'Andre Swift, Eagles (worth six points); Derrick Henry, Titans (worth seven points); Alvin Kamara, Saints (worth eight points); Kenneth Walker III, Seahawks (worth nine points)",
      "It seems obvious with the lowest point total here, but D\u2019Andre Swift has to be the call. The Titans' offense will be playing a backup QB, so you know the Falcons' defense will take Henry away and make Will Levis or Malik Willis beat them. Walker faces a good Browns defense, so I don't know how many yards he\u2019ll have. Kamara could be boom or bust. He\u2019s had a weird season statistically.\u00a0",
      "I'm sticking with my instinct here, give me Swift.",

      "This is a tough one, as no order would surprise me here. But I'll go Rams, Colts, Vikings and Texans.\u00a0",
      "I think the Rams will throw a ton vs. Dallas, and if they are behind, they could put up some hollow yards as they try to come back. Shane Steichen\u2019s offense has produced whether Anthony Richardson or Gardner Minshew has been under center, and I like them to beat New Orleans this week. Kirk Cousins had a huge game Monday night. Can he repeat it? Houston faces a bad Carolina team, and C.J. Stroud should put up good numbers but probably the lowest of this quartet.",
      "Prediction: Rams, Colts, Vikings, Texans",
      "Which defensive player will record the MOST SACKS?Danielle Hunter, Vikings (seven points); T.J. Watt, Steelers (eight points); Myles Garrett, Browns (nine points); Micah Parsons, Cowboys (10 points)",
      "Both Myles Garrett and Micah Parsons have great matchups this week, as they will be going against two below-average OLs in Seattle and the Rams. Why not go for the big points with Parsons? Especially since the Rams' offense will continue to put the ball in the air as the RB position has been depleted with the injury to Kyren Williams.\u00a0",
      "Prediction: Micah Parsons",
      "What will be the outcome of the Browns-Seahawks game?Browns Win, Tie or Lose by 2 points or fewer; Seahawks win by 3 or more points",
      "Cleveland was fortunate to win last week in Indy, partly due to its defense having its worst game of the season. The defense should be able to get back on track going against a bad offensive line in Seattle, as evidenced by what the Bengals' pass rush was able to do a couple of weeks ago vs. Geno Smith & Co. I like this matchup for the Browns \u2014 even if it is P.J. Walker again at QB.\u00a0",

    "paragraphs": [
      "There is no controversy about the quarterbacks in New York. When Daniel Jones is healthy, the New York Giants are still his team. Nothing Tyrod Taylor has done the past two games has likely changed that.",
      "But that also doesn't change the inconvenient truth for the Giants that Taylor, their veteran backup, performed better on Sunday than Jones had in most of his five starts this season. And the Giants offense, while only marginally more productive, looked much better with Taylor in charge.",
      "Taylor was efficient and careful with the football. His quick decisions helped out the struggling offensive line. And at least in the first half of the Giants' 14-7 win over the Washington Commanders, New York's offense moved far more smoothly than it has for most of the year.",
      "That's not because Taylor, a 34-year-old journeyman, is better than Jones. It's not a sign that he gives the Giants a better chance to win. And it's definitely not a reason for the Giants to make a quarterback change less than eight months and half a season after signing the 26-year-old Jones to a four-year, $160 million contract.",
      "Though to be fair, when asked after the game if Taylor had done enough to remain the starter even when Jones (neck) is finally cleared for contact, Giants coach Brian Daboll didn't exactly say no.",
      "\"I would just say Tyrod had a good game this game and he's a true pro,\" Daboll said, \"and I'm glad we've got him.\"",
      "While that non-answer was perfect fodder for the talk-radio shows and tabloids, it's almost certainly not an indication that any change is coming. Still, Taylor's \"good game\" is a chance to learn, even for Jones, to see why he was so relatively successful running the offense. Taylor was 18 for 29 for 279 yards and two touchdowns, and the Giants had 356 yards of offense \u2014 their second-highest total of the season and highest in the last five games.\u00a0",
      "Some of it was situational. Some was circumstantial. Some of it was because of things Taylor did. But it's still worth looking at what went right and what factors contributed to Taylor's success, and whether any of it can help Jones when he returns:",
      "Quick passes/decisions: In the first half, at least, Taylor looked extremely decisive, and it appeared the offensive game plan was designed for him to get the ball out quickly. That makes sense, given how good the Commanders' defensive line is. It remains the best way to counteract a pass rush. It also allows the offensive playmakers to do the work. And a big sign of that focus was how effective tight end Darren Waller was in this game \u2014 his best as a Giant, with seven catches for 98 yards and a touchdown. He's such a big target he should always be the quarterback's best friend when they need to get the ball out fast.",
      "Taylor looked more comfortable in a collapsing pocket: There are no stats to gauge this, but compared to the way Jones looked so jittery over the past few weeks, it was hard not to see how calm Taylor appeared. He was able to stand more in the pocket and get throws out under pressure. And when he had to escape trouble, he wasn't just running away in a panic. He made several terrific, off-schedule throws when he was flushed out of the pocket and found a receiver on the run. Of course, given the beating Jones has taken \u2014 28 sacks in his five starts \u2014 it's easy to see why he had lost his comfort level. Taylor didn't come with that baggage. And he reminded everyone how important that is.",
      "More deep throws: Taylor completed two passes for 75 yards to speedy rookie Jalin Hyatt and targeted him five times \u2014 the most the 22-year-old receiver been targeted in a game this season. In fact, in Taylor's two starts, he's thrown in Hyatt's direction nine times. Jones only threw to him five times in the first five games. So it's about time the Giants made him a big part of their offense. Taylor rightfully called him \"one of the fastest guys on the field, if not the fastest at any given point.\"\u00a0It's true that Jones had been under so much pressure in the pocket in general that the idea of waiting for Hyatt's deep routes to develop seemed like a fantasy. But as Taylor noted, there is value sometimes in just throwing it up quickly and letting the kid see if he can catch up to the ball and make a play. Speed can kill in this game. It also can soften up the defense and open up more of the mid-range routes. That's what it did against Washington's struggling secondary, which made it easier for Taylor to find open receivers all over the field.",
      "The return of Saquon Barkley: Don't underestimate this. In Taylor's two starts, Barkley has rushed 45 times for 170 yards. In the previous three games, with Jones at quarterback and Barkley out, the running backs combined for 47 carries for 107 yards. Without Barkley, the Giants were completely one-dimensional. Defenses didn't respect the Giants' rushing attack and they found it easier to close off Jones' running lanes too. With Barkley on the field, it changes their approach. They have to commit more defenders to the line of scrimmage. That leaves fewer players to cover and gives a quarterback more options when he throws. Barkley doesn't even have to be good to have an impact. He just has to be there.",
      "The offensive line was better: Don't get the wrong idea. The Giants' offensive line still isn't good. But it has stabilized a bit the past two games, and Taylor had a decent amount of time on Sunday against a strong Commanders front. It's hard to know why. Justin \"Straight off the couch\" Pugh had his issues at left tackle with Chase Young, and Tyre Phillips wasn't perfect at right tackle either. Veteran guard Mark Glowinski has definitely played better since his return to the lineup. But they are still missing three starters \u2014 left tackle Andrew Thomas, center John Michael Schmitz and right tackle Evan Neal. The why doesn't really matter, though. A better performance from the line makes all the difference in the world for a quarterback. And their performance was enough to help Taylor. That's a luxury Jones didn't have.",
      "The Giants hope, obviously, that when Jones returns \u2014 possibly as soon as this Sunday against the New York Jets \u2014 that Barkley will still be in the lineup and the offensive line will still be trending up. That will definitely help him rediscover his comfort in the pocket. And it's a good bet the coaching staff will put an emphasis on more quick passes, mixing in Hyatt and the occasional deep throws.",
      "Don't forget, though, that even with all that going right the Giants' offense is still somewhat dysfunctional. For all the praise Taylor is getting, the Giants are still only averaging 11.5 points per game during his two starts \u2014 almost a full point less than they were averaging under Jones (12.4). But the offense is undoubtedly moving better. Under Jones, the Giants averaged just 255.2 yards per game. In two starts for Taylor, they've averaged 336.",
      "Again, it has a lot to do with the circumstances \u2014 including the competition. Don't forget, the Commanders statistically have the fourth-worst defense in the NFL. The Giants are sure Jones can do better if the circumstances are similar. They were so sure of it that they made a $40 million-per-year bet on it back in March. A little very modest success by Jones' backup isn't going to change their feeling about their franchise quarterback \u2014 at least not yet.",
      "What Taylor's success does, though, is give them a window into what a semi-functional offense looks like. And it gives them a roadmap for finding ways to help Jones have a little of that same success.",

      "Marquez Valdes-Scantling had three catches for 84 yards and a touchdown, Rashee Rice and Isiah Pacheco also caught TD passes, and the Chiefs (6-1) won their sixth straight to take a three-game lead in a division they have won seven straight years.",
      "The Chiefs were leading 24-17 midway through the fourth quarter when Mecole Hardman, who returned to Kansas City this week in a trade with the New York Jets, brought back a punt 50 yards. That gave Kansas City a short field and, six plays later, Mahomes hit Pacheco out of the backfield for the touchdown that put the game away.",
      "The Chargers' Justin Herbert, who spent the day under constant pressure from the league's No. 2 scoring defense, had 259 yards passing with a touchdown and two interceptions. Joshua Palmer caught five passes for 133 yards and Joshua Kelley ran seven times for 75 yards and a score.",
      "The Chiefs had been relying all season on their defense to bail out an offense that had struggled to hit its stride.",
      "Mahomes & Co. finally found it in the first half.",
      "After an opening drive that netted a field goal, the reigning league MVP capped three of the next four drives with TD passes. The first was a 46-yard strike to Valdes-Scantling, the second to Rice, and the final one \u2014 almost fittingly \u2014 a flip from the 1-yard line to Kelce, who bulldozed through a group of defenders and into the end zone with 15 seconds left in the first half.",
      "That prompted big cheers from the home crowd, including Taylor Swift, who watched from a luxury suite and celebrated with a personalized handshake with Brittany Mahomes, the QB's wife.",
      "The score left Mahomes with 321 yards passing, the fourth time in his career that he had been over 300 yards before halftime. And it left Kelce with nine catches for 143 yards and a score.",
      "It only left the Chiefs with a 24-17 lead, though, because the Chargers were getting some big plays of their own.",
      "After the Chargers evened the score with a field goal of their own, Kelley got loose for a 49-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter. And after Herbert connected with Palmer for 60 yards down the middle of the field, the Los Angeles quarterback found Gerald Everett in the end zone for a touchdown.",
      "Given all the first-half offense, the second half was a dud. Both teams put together long drives in the third quarter, and both of them ended up with turnovers, leaving the Chiefs clinging to their 24-17 lead heading into the fourth.",
      "Swift was again in attendance to watch Kelce and the Chiefs. She was seen wearing a friendship bracelet with \"87\" on it. Kelce's failed attempt to give her a friendship bracelet during her Eras Tour led to the tight end's courtship of the pop star, and an invitation to a game at Arrowhead Stadium. Swift took him up on it and they have been seeing each other ever since.",
      "Chiefs pass rusher Charles Omenihu, who was suspended the first six games for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy, made his debut in a big way. He had a sack in the first half and tipped a pass that L'Jarius Sneed picked off in the second.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "As the NFL trade deadline fast approaches, the 4-2 Cowboys appear to be in a spot to add as they look to finally get over the hump in the NFC. However, Jerry Jones is giving mixed messages on what his team might do ahead of the Oct. 31 deadline.\u00a0",
      "The Cowboys owner and general manager told reporters Thursday that his team doesn't have any imminent trades and seemed to temper expectations over a possible deadline move before signaling that Dallas will make a move.",
      "\"I don't think there's anything at a level that I would expect to do anything,\" Jones said of possible trade talks surrounding the Cowboys. \"I don't see anything heated up to a level that would cause something to happen.\"",
      "Earlier in the week, Jones indicated a similar sentiment about the trade deadline, sharing that teams would have to approach the Cowboys about making a deal rather than the other way around. Jones reiterated that thought, stating that he feels good about his Cowboys squad.\u00a0",
      "\"It's both, as you all know, that's a two-edged answer,\" Jones said on whether Dallas' relative inactivity is due to his liking the roster or because of what teams are offering. \"I do like this roster. Would I improve it if given an opportunity and it made a lot of sense? Of course we would. But if we don't do anything at this trade deadline, we've got a team in my mind that can get us where we want to go.\"",
      "But Jones then reversed course on some of his earlier comments. When asked if teams have recently been more willing to make moves at the trade deadline than in the past, Jones said that was the case and indicated that his team has been a part of it.",
      "\"I think there is a trade mentality or a deal mentality,\" Jones said. \"Maybe it has to do with the turnover, if you will, turnover at the executive level, general manager level. Guys are trying to make something happen. That\u2019s a healthy thing. I\u2019m, by nature, active and, by nature, a risk-taker, so don\u2019t come by unless you want to get struck at.\u00a0",
      "\"We will trade. There\u2019s no mistake about it. We will make a deal. But it\u2019s certainly got a high bar because I like our team.\"",
      "The Cowboys have made a handful of notable moves at the trade deadline dating all the way back to Jones' first season with the team in 1989. But they haven't made many major in-season moves since they traded a first-round pick for Amari Cooper at the deadline in 2018.\u00a0",
      "While it still isn't clear if the Cowboys will make a trade or not, what is clear is that Jones likes his team. Earlier in the week, he stated that he thinks the Cowboys rank among the NFC elite.",
      "\"Well, we belong in the upper echelons,\" Jones told 105.3 The Fan. \"I'm not going to say we belong on the field with [the 49ers], and we haven't played Philly, but we've anticipated Philadelphia being what they look like. I don't wanna go that far, but we're in the upper echelon.\""

Heard's daughter, 23-year-old Jamea Jonae Harris, was shot and killed early in the morning on Jan. 15.",
      "Both Miles and Davis are charged with capital murder while Miller was described as a cooperating witness. The former Alabama All-American, who was selected No. 2 in June's NBA draft, was not charged with a crime.",

      "Los Angeles Rams receiver Cooper Kupp began the season on the injured reserve list with a hamstring injury up until making his debut two weeks ago. While he was sidelined, Kupp was encouraged by the production he saw from the team's rookies, which convinced him that the Rams can make a run this season.",
      "\"It's hard [not being able to play],\" Kupp said in an interview with former Super Bowl champion receiver and \"FOX NFL Kickoff\" host Julian Edelman. \"But I was truly just enthusiastic and excited to see these guys go out there and play the way they were.\"\u00a0",
      "Puka Nacua, a fifth-round pick in this year's draft, was one of the receivers who stepped up during Kupp's absence. This season, the rookie receiver is tied for a league-leading 50 receptions for 598 yards and two touchdowns.\u00a0",
      "Nacua's remarkable production is one example that supports Kupp's belief that the Rams can be special with this group of rookies.",
      "\"Man, if we could get a few of these rookies to come be a part of this thing and do their job, shoot, we could be dangerous,\" Kupp said.\u00a0",
      "When Kupp was eventually cleared to play in Week 5 against the Philadelphia Eagles, the former Super Bowl MVP didn't miss a beat. Kupp hauled in eight receptions on 12 targets for 118 yards, as his connection with quarterback Matthew Stafford was immediately re-established.\u00a0",
      "\"It helps when your quarterback is really good,\" Kupp said. \"Matthew wants to be a part of you winning your route, he wants to be a part of your success.\"\u00a0",
      "Kupp and Stafford successfully brought a Lombardi Trophy to Los Angeles during their first season together in 2021. With Kupp back on the field, the pair will look to make a playoff push, along with the help of the team's talented rookies.",

      "Given the incredibly talented quarterback class likely declaring for the 2024 draft \u2014 including USC's Caleb Williams and UNC's Drake Maye \u2014 many have speculated that the Cardinals may consider moving on from Murray if they own a top pick.\u00a0",

      "New England is bringing its six Super Bowl trophies. How about a yacht? Kansas City has that, not to mention the star quarterback and tight end.",
      "They\u2019re all headed to Frankfurt to take part in two weeks of American football because beyond the games, there are German fans to win over. A lot of them.",
      "\"Most Germans don\u2019t have a team yet,\" said Alexander Steinforth, the NFL\u2019s general manager for Germany.",
      "The fandom is in the millions \u2014 a barely tapped gold mine for teams and a league that have mostly maxed out domestically. The league says it has 18 million casual fans, or roughly one in five residents of Germany and about 3.6 million \"avid\" ones.",
      "\"We are reaching that state of maturity where you see fans are actively seeking out teams and are looking for teams that they can follow,\" Steinforth said. \"That\u2019s why the market is so exciting for franchises to be active in because right now they have a massive opportunity to pick up fans.\"",
      "The Chiefs go first; they\u2019ll play the Miami Dolphins on Sunday. A week later, the Patriots face the Indianapolis Colts. Both games are at Deutsche Bank Park, the home of German soccer club Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "The Chiefs and Patriots both have commercial rights in Germany under the league\u2019s global markets program, as do the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Carolina Panthers and Atlanta Falcons. It means they can sign corporate sponsorship deals, hold events to attract fans and sell merchandise as they do in their home markets.",
      "\"This is a home game for us being in Frankfurt and we'll be utilizing our gameday production,\" said Chiefs chairman Clark Hunt, whose team also has rights to Austria, Switzerland and Mexico. \"I expect to have a similar feel (to their London game in 2015), but their big difference is we've been in Frankfurt for a year and a half doing marketing.\"",
      "Life has been pretty good for the Chiefs. They\u2019re the defending Super Bowl champions, quarterback Patrick Mahomes is the reigning MVP, and All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce is having another big season. Oh yeah, Kelce also appears to be in a relationship with global megastar Taylor Swift, which only adds to the buzz every time the Chiefs take the field.",
      "\"It\u2019s perfect timing for us as a franchise and we\u2019re going to be very aggressive in taking full advantage of that,\" said Chiefs president Mark Donovan, adding the club has spent about $1 million in preparation and fan events for Frankfurt.",
      "Part of that went to the team docking a Chiefs-themed yacht in the Main River for fans to board and get a selfie with the Lombardi trophy, which it won for the third time with its 38-35 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl.",
      "Both the Chiefs and Patriots wanted last year\u2019s first-ever regular-season game in Munich, but that went to the Bucs and Tom Brady, in part because NFC teams had the extra home game. The Bucs beat the Seattle Seahawks 21-16 at Allianz Arena in what Steinforth said was the NFL's \"most-successful international game\" in terms of viewership and merchandise sales. He added that German viewership this season on free-to-air broadcaster RTL is up \"9 to 10%\" from a year ago.",
      "Though five teams are in the market, the Chiefs and Patriots \"have been the most aggressive and probably have the most foothold,\" Donovan said. New England has some advantages, he added, \"because they\u2019ve been there longer and they have some German players and German radio and things like that.\"",
      "New England saw a surge of interest after selecting German offensive lineman Sebastian Vollmer in 2009. They began pushing German content into the country, and for a while the Super Bowl titles kept coming, all coinciding with NFL games airing weekly on free TV network ProSieben. The league switched to the bigger RTL starting this season.",
      "\"I would say we are the No. 1 (team) or we have been for many, many years,\" said Joe Dorant, the Patriots senior director of business development for the region, \"but obviously we\u2019re running up against the Kansas City Chiefs, who are doing really well right now and their popularity is soaring.\"",
      "All six of New England\u2019s Lombardi trophies will be on display for fans and photos at \"Patriots Haus\" downtown and alumni will be greeting the locals.",
      "But competing with Swift?",
      "\"I don\u2019t think we can,\" Dorant said. \"The only thing we can do is show the German people what the Patriot way is. We\u2019ve been successful for many, many years \u2014 for a 20-year span. No other team can say that.\"",
      "Kansas City already had the fastest-growing Instagram and TikTok engagement in Germany among NFL teams and that was \"pre-Taylor,\" Donovan said. Among the five teams in the market, the Chiefs have the most Instagram followers on their German account, but the Panthers have the edge on TikTok.",
      "\"I don't know at this point if she\u2019s going to Germany or not,\" Donovan said of the 12-time Grammy-winning superstar.",
      "Kelce is sure to face questions about Swift from the locals. After all, Brady was grilled about his personal life after his divorce from supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen; a TV producer also presented Brady with Bavarian lederhosen.",
      "Who knows what awaits Kelce in Germany.",
      "Teams have hired German agencies and advisers to facilitate deals, and the Chiefs' sponsorship agreements include fast food and pet food. But they didn't need help figuring out they can gain visibility through Germany's top sport: soccer.",
      "Bundesliga champion Bayern Munich has more than 40 million Instagram followers, whereas the Patriots are tops in the NFL with 5 million. The Chiefs' German account is just under 46,000.",
      "While the Panthers partnered with Eintracht Frankfurt and New England hosted the German national team in Foxborough, Massachusetts, the Chiefs have linked up with Bayern through the Hunt family-owned FC Dallas.",
      "\"My first intro to Germany came in 1974 attending World Cup games in West Germany,\" said Hunt, whose franchise is already preparing to host 2026 World Cup games at Arrowhead Stadium. \"We're looking forward to this trip and showcasing the best of Chiefs Kingdom.\"",
      "The Panthers and Falcons would figure to be next in line for a game in Germany. It is slated to host one game next year, which the NFL confirmed Monday will be in Munich, and another one in 2025.",
      "\"We would have no issue with playing a game next year and the year after,\" the Patriots' Dorant said.",
      "The Chiefs and Patriots are the designated \"home\" teams in Frankfurt. The Chiefs are such a big draw that other teams don't want to give up a visit from them.",
      "\"We\u2019d like to be more aggressive in being in the international markets more often,\" Donovan said. \"Right now, we\u2019d only do it as an away team ideally, or during those years when we have the extra home game.\"",
      "It\u2019s widely expected that the NFL will extend its deal in Germany. The league opened an office in Dusseldorf with a capacity for 25 employees.",
      "\"That\u2019s the idea, to grow into it,\" Steinforth said.",

      "A.J. Brown, Eagles (worth five points); Puka Nacua, Rams (worth six points); CeeDee Lamb, Cowboys (worth seven points); Terry McLaurin, Commanders (worth eight points)",
      "I\u2019ll go with Puka Nacua in a bit of an upset here. Nacua may actually benefit in targets if Matthew Stafford is out, as he tends to look toward Cooper Kupp quite a bit. The Packers are proving to be one of the worst teams in the league. They can't seem to stay on the field offensively, as Jordan Love has been no bueno. Gimme Nacua.\u00a0",
      "Prediction: Puka Nacua\u00a0",
      "Order the teams by who will score the MOST POINTS from highest to lowest:",
      "Vikings, Falcons, Commanders, Patriots",
      "Let's go Patriots, Commanders, Vikings, Falcons. I expect the Washington defense to continue to struggle, but the offense put up 31 on Philly last week, so there is no reason to expect it to slow down here. I like the Vikings in Atlanta. I know there\u2019s a new QB and no Justin Jefferson, but I\u2019ll take a chance with an upset over an Atlanta team that's not capable of blowing out anyone.\u00a0",
      "Prediction: Patriots, Commanders, Vikings, Falcons",
      "Which team's defense will record the MOST SACKS?",
      "Commanders (worth seven points), Eagles (worth eight points), Vikings (worth nine points), Cowboys (worth 10 points)\u00a0",
      "In the Vikings defense, we trust (against Taylor Heinecke)! I would think about the Cowboys if you choose not to ride with me on the Vikings. With an injured Jalen Hurts, he may not be able to elude a potent Dallas pass rush.\u00a0",
      "Prediction: Vikings",
      "Order the running backs by who will have the most RUSHING YARDS from highest to lowest:",
      "Tony Pollard, Cowboys; D'Andre Swift, Eagles; Josh Jacobs, Raiders; Saquon Barkley, Giants",
      "I guess I have to go, Barkley, no? I mean, the Giants have no other way to move the ball. It is a dangerous strategy since the opponent knows what\u2019s coming, but even last week against the Jets, he had a big game. I\u2019d assume Jacobs would be next. New coach. New QB. New OC. I can't put it all on Aidan O\u2019Connell here. I\u2019ll fill it out with Pollard three and Swift four.\u00a0",

      "Jalen Hurts, Eagles (worth six points); Dak Prescott, Cowboys (worth seven points); Mac Jones, Patriots (worth eight points); Matthew Stafford, Rams (worth nine points)",
      "Interesting. I\u2019d have to go with Hurts because he likely will not be as much of a running threat. Matthew Stafford may not play, the Patriots may just be able to run the ball right down the field and Dallas may use a run-first attack. The Eagles will need to throw to win.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "Thursday night in Buffalo marked the third time in seven games in which the Bucs have faced a top-tier NFL team, and while they made it interesting late, all three games weren't close for most of the second half. The Bucs trailed 25-3 in the fourth against the Eagles, lost 20-6 to the Lions and were down 24-10 to Buffalo with four minutes to play.",
      "Tampa Bay now has a long weekend to ponder where they fit into the NFL and the NFC South. It's clear this isn't a great team, but that's the same observation you could have made a year ago, even with Tom Brady at quarterback.",
      "Brady's three years in Tampa raised the bar for what makes a successful season, with a Super Bowl championship and then back-to-back division titles, the last coming despite a losing record. And given that this year's Bucs have $35 million in salary-cap space devoted to Brady's old contract, part of over $70 million in dead money, it's understandable, even expected, that they're not great.",
      "Having said that, mere \"good\" can go a long way in this year's NFC South. With Tampa Bay sitting at No. 16 in this week's FOX NFL Power Rankings, squarely in the middle of the league, if all they do is lose to the teams above them and beat the teams below them, they'll manage to finish with a better record than Brady's Bucs did a year ago.",
      "Just to show the math on this: The Bucs are 3-4, and only have four remaining games against teams ranking higher in the current rankings: at the Texans next week, at the 49ers in three weeks and games against the Falcons and Jaguars in December. The other six are against teams all ranked 21st or lower. If the seeds hold, if you will, the Bucs go 9-8, which might not win the South, but could be a wild card, perhaps a playoff berth more fairly earned than last year's. Now the Falcons are 4-3 and have 10 games against teams all ranked lower than them, so the Bucs also need Atlanta to stumble a bit if they're going to contend for the division.",
      "Fans don't like being in the middle of the NFL, even for a year. We're less than halfway into the season, but teams are quickly sorted into those vying for championships and those contending for top draft picks. There isn't much excitement in the middle. The NFL's trade deadline is Tuesday, and the Bucs are neither buyers nor sellers \u2014 they're only a game out of first, with the same record as a current NFC wild-card team, so they're not going to break up the band by dealing Mike Evans, Devin White or anyone else. But it's also hard to make a good case for them giving up future draft picks for any major additions.",
      "This is the Year After Brady for the Bucs, so it's a season of economic hardship and limited spending for bargain signings. If it isn't a rebuild in the standings, it is in the financial ledger, trying to get back to salary-cap flexibility. They will do well just to sign the best of their own free agents this coming spring, with Antoine Winfield, Mike Evans, Lavonte David and Devin White setting up difficult choices for some of the biggest names from the Super Bowl team and before. They'll also have to decide what to do at quarterback again, knowing Baker Mayfield will command more than $4 million a year next spring.",
      "If the season-opening win at Minnesota and the 3-1 start was a pleasant surprise for Bucs fans, three straight losses off their bye week offer sobering perspective. Losing to the Falcons meant putting Atlanta in the driver's seat for the division, so that might be the most damaging of the four losses.",
      "This is a strangely flawed Bucs team. They went into Thursday's game with the NFL's worst third-down defense and the best red-zone defense, a confounding dual existence where they can't get off the field for most drives, then steel up near the goal line, with perhaps too much experience in those situations to feel encouraged by the trend. They lead the NFL in turnover margin, a crucial and central statistic, and yet one they've overcome to be the 3-4 team that they are.",
      "The offensive talent can be frustrating. Mike Evans was a ghost for most of Thursday night, managing a late touchdown to give him five this season. Chris Godwin, as reliable as they come, just got his first touchdown of the season Thursday \u2014 if he turns around a second earlier on the Hail Mary, he has two, and we're writing a much different story today. Rachaad White has disappointed running the ball, as has the entire team, but has also shown a spark in the passing game the last two weeks. Even Tristan Wirfs, an all-world talent already at home at left tackle, has drawn as many penalties (3) as he's had in any of his NFL seasons.",
      "The saddest debate of last year's NFL season was whether the NFC South or AFC South was the weakest division. The NFC South didn't have a team with a winning record, but the AFC South had a much worse overall record. The next four weeks for the Bucs include three games against AFC South teams \u2014 next week at the Texans (3-3), then home against the Titans (3-4) and after a difficult trip to San Francisco, they go to the Colts (2-4). Sweep those three games, and even with a loss to the 49ers, they're still 6-5 with six games left, including two against the still-winless Panthers.",
      "[Panthers\u2019 Bryce Young vs. Texans\u2019 C.J. Stroud: What to expect in their first matchup]",
      "This does not look to be a remarkable season for the Bucs, but for all the disappointment of another blah loss, everything is still in play for them, especially in the middling division they call their own. Solve the third-down defense, improve the pass rush a bit, find some semblance of a run game as Dave Canales gets his bearings as an NFL play-caller, and this is a team that can play with \u2014 if not beat \u2014 most of the opponents left on their schedule.",
      "That isn't exciting by Brady standards, but it's probably better than most expected of the Bucs in 2023. They don't have to be great this season, but simple, lower-case, unremarkably good can still go a long way.",

      "The Buffalo Bills didn't exactly get right in their 24-18 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 8. But for a Buffalo team that has played beneath themselves for three straight weeks, the Bills' performance on Thursday was a vast improvement.",
      "There was one sequence in which the offense shot itself in the foot. Quarterback Josh Allen threw an interception, which Baker Mayfield converted into a quick touchdown and capped off a 10-point run in 54 seconds.\u00a0",
      "There was also a sequence where the defense shot itself in the foot. On the Buccaneers' penultimate drive, the Bills committed a facemask penalty on a fourth-down sack that, rather than ending the game, gave life to what ended up being a touchdown drive. That touchdown came on a pass that grazed cornerback Christian Benford\u2019s helmet. And the two-point conversion that followed came on a high, tipped pass that fell inexplicably into the hands of tight end Cade Otten.",
      "Bad play and bad luck. But only in small doses.",
      "It was a whole lot better than the 60 minutes of mess that we\u2019ve seen in the last two weeks, with their narrow victory over the New York Giants and their narrow defeat to the New England Patriots.",
      "If there was a clue to how the Bills offense would get their groove back, it came during Allen\u2019s press conference.",
      "\"I need to think a little bit less and just play football,\" Allen said last week.",
      "It was Allen\u2019s legs \u2014 not his arm \u2014 that began to get the Bills offense right. For the most part, he took what the defense gave him (except for the interception, an attempted screen pass that he should have turfed). Allen checked down, when appropriate. He found holes in the intermediate. And he never forced the ball to Stefon Diggs, who the Buccaneers focused intently upon covering with a large portion of double teams. And then when the rush came or the receivers were covered, Allen took the yards in front of him. With his legs.",
      "He had seven carries for 41 yards and a 13-yard rushing touchdown to go with his 324 passing yards, two passing touchdowns and an interception.",
      "After leading the team in rushing in 2022 (124 carries, 762 yards, 7 TDs), Allen was averaging just four carries for 21 rushing yards per game. It was clear the Bills wanted to keep their quarterback out of danger, particularly when he was making some absolutely irresponsible decisions in the open field \u2014 where he found himself attempting dives into contact and over defenders. It resulted in way too much mileage on the body for one of the two most talented throwers in the NFL.",
      "But after a few weeks of inconsistent offense and lackluster energy in the first quarter (when they had not scored a single point from Week 5 through Week 7), Buffalo needed a spark on offense. And there was some thought that spark might come from Allen running the football.",
      "\"It\u2019s a good point,\" McDermott said on Monday.",
      "The beauty of what Allen did on Thursday night came at the end of his runs. He slid. He fell forward without taking a hit. He actually took care of himself.\u00a0",
      "Of course, he did take a hit on a rollout pass that seemed to flare up his shoulder injury \u2014 which will be worth monitoring next week. But when it came to designed runs or upfield scrambles, he avoided big hits.\u00a0",
      "\"Everything in moderation,\" McDermott said prior to the game.",
      "Allen picked up first downs and touchdowns. It made a massive difference for the offense. It even helped the passing game.",
      "You could see how Allen\u2019s rushing prowess moved the defense on Dalton Kincaid\u2019s touchdown in the first half. Buccaneers linebacker Lavonte David cheated toward the line of scrimmage after Allen scrambled. That created a gap in Tampa\u2019s zone \u2014 which Allen swiftly exploited. Kincaid cut upfield and ran into the end zone untouched for the first score of the rookie tight end\u2019s career. And that was the biggest catch on a big night for him.\u00a0",
      "With tight end Dawson Knox going on injured reserve for wrist surgery, Kincaid finished with five catches for 65 yards and the touchdown.",
      "The offense, on the whole, looked healthier from top to bottom. Diggs might not have put up huge numbers, with nine catches for 70 yards. He did, however, make a first-down catch with two minutes left that all but clinched the win for that. But all that defensive attention gave life to big games from Khalil Shakir, with six catches for 92 yards, and Gabe Davis, with nine catches for 87 yards and a touchdown.",
      "The question is whether this is a permanent solution for the Bills.",
      "Can the Bills really keep letting Allen into harm\u2019s way?",
      "The Bills went into this season with a clear goal: Ask Allen to throw more and run less. The reasoning is obvious. Look at Cam Newton\u2019s career when compared to that of Matthew Stafford. Newton was drafted two years after Stafford. But it\u2019s Stafford who is still in the league \u2014 and at the center of a proficient passing attack (even despite its putrid offensive line). Stafford won a Super Bowl after Newton was forced to retire. And it\u2019s easy to see why Newton saw his physical decline before Stafford \u2014 Newton was a physical, running quarterback.",
      "The Bills signed Allen, 27, through the 2028 season. He is the kind of quarterback that teams dream of having at the center of their offense. After all, he already has a shoulder injury. Last season, he was playing through and elbow injury. The hits are taking their toll.",
      "They must weigh their urgency to win a championship in his prime against using him as a runner in ways that will actively shorten that window.\u00a0",

    "paragraphs": [
      "Travis Kelce might be dating Taylor Swift, but when it comes to the Chiefs' upset loss against the Broncos on Sunday, the star NFL tight end is not taking the pop star's famous advice to \"Shake It Off.\"",
      "On the most recent episode of the podcast he co-hosts with his brother Jason Kelce, Travis was still smarting from Kansas City's loss. Denver had entered Week 8 with a 2-5 record and had not beaten the Chiefs since September 2015, when Peyton Manning was still the Broncos' quarterback.",
      "\"F---, that's embarrassing, man,\" Travis said as soon as Jason brought up the 24-9 final score. \"It felt awkward during the game, like we couldn't get anything going. You talk about that sense of urgency on the sideline, it didn't feel like we had too much of that. And when we finally had that sense of urgency, we turned the ball over and got it ripped right out of our hearts.",
      "\"Our defense is playing their tail off, man. And for us to keep turning it over, putting them in bad positions and them saving our tail, it's getting real one-sided.\"",
      "To Travis' point, the Chiefs \u2014 whose identity during their current dynastic run has been in their three-headed offensive monster of head coach Andy Reid, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Kelce \u2014 have the second-best scoring defense in the NFL this season, allowing just 16.1 points per game, and rank fifth in defensive DVOA. But the Chiefs offense has sputtered in recent weeks behind an inconsistent passing attack that lacks depth behind Travis Kelce.",
      "\"I don't think I've been in a situation where we've stalled this much as an offense throughout the year,\" Kelce said. \"Definitely at this point in the season. We have a lot of guys that usually figure out how to get this thing going. It's just frustrating, man. \u2026 We've got, in my mind, the best offensive mind in the game [Reid], we've got the best quarterback [Mahomes]. So this is unacceptable, and we all feel that way. Don't think we're not feeling the urgency.\"",
      "Kelce leads Kansas City with 583 receiving yards despite missing the Chiefs' season opener with an injury. The next-highest receiving yards total on the Chiefs belongs to 23-year-old rookie Rashee Rice with 361 yards.",
      "The Chiefs have had several notable departures on offense in recent seasons \u2014 most notably Tyreek Hill, who was traded to the Miami Dolphins before the 2022 season and remains one of the best wideouts in the NFL, and former offensive coordinator Eric Bienemy, who left for the same role with the Washington Commanders after the Chiefs' Super Bowl triumph last February.",
      "Kansas City still has one of the NFL's best records at 6-2 and remains among the betting favorites to win this year's Super Bowl, which would be their third championship in five seasons.",

      "Back the other way!",
      "Miami's offense has carried most of its success this season, but this time, the defense got in on the scoring, as Jerome Baker made off with a tipped pass for an interception touchdown.",
      "Say hey, AJ!",

      "Make the play Slay!",
      "That's why they call him \"Big Play!\" The Dolphins nearly got into the red zone after a 40-plus-yard drive, but in their attempt to tie the game, Darius Slay emerged with a game-changing interception at the one-yard line.",
      "Are you serious?",
      "Only three wide receivers in NFL history have had five straight games with at least 125 yards, and AJ Brown is one of them. He passed the benchmark in this game with his best catch of the day, an absolute stunner.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "The NFL world will get to see Bryce Young and C.J. Stroud, the top two picks in the 2023 draft, face off for the first time this weekend.\u00a0",
      "Young's Panthers (0-6) will host Stroud's Texans (3-3) Sunday at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte (1 p.m. ET on FOX and the FOX Sports app). The No. 1 overall pick, Young has had a rough go to start his career with reeling Carolina, the only team in the NFL without a win. It's been the opposite for Stroud, the No. 2 pick, who has already looked like a franchise quarterback leading a Houston team that's more competitive than anyone expected.\u00a0",
      "Why have Stroud and Young's rookie seasons been so different to this point? What does that mean for their matchup Sunday?\u00a0",
      "FOX Sports NFC South reporter Greg Auman and AFC South reporter Ben Arthur discuss in a roundtable preview:\u00a0",
      "Auman: Ben, I have to start with this: How was C.J. Stroud able to go that long before he threw his first NFL interception? (Context: Stroud broke Dak Prescott's record for most passes without an interception to start a career. Prescott threw 176 times before being intercepted. Stroud's streak ended at 192 in Week 6 vs. New Orleans).\u00a0",
      "Arthur: It's funny; the Saints didn't even have a drive after being the first team to pick off Stroud. Texans receiver Nico Collins forced a fumble on the interception return, right tackle Tytus Howard recovered the ball and Houston turned the possession into a touchdown \u2014 a Stroud connection to tight end Dalton Schultz at the goal line.\u00a0",
      "But to answer your question, I think it's tied to the comfort and confidence he's playing with. Even at Ohio State, he didn't put the ball in harm's way. He had just a 1.4% interception rate across 830 pass attempts for the Buckeyes. That's a mark that would rank fourth in the NFL this season among qualified quarterbacks (Stroud currently leads the NFL with a 0.5% interception rate).",
      "Stroud has been everything the Texans could've hoped for and more, much sooner than anyone could have anticipated. He has arguably been a top-10 quarterback to start this season. All the things we saw him do well at Ohio State \u2014 processing quickly, elite ball placement, throwing with decisiveness and anticipation, etc. \u2014 have shown up in the NFL.\u00a0",
      "But I'm curious, Greg \u00a0\u2014 why has it been such a struggle for Young early in Frank Reich's offense?\u00a0",
      "Auman: I've been surprised how much they've struggled, given the brain trust of offensive coaches brought in to work with Young, from Frank Reich to OC Thomas Brown to QBs coach Josh McCown and assistant Jim Caldwell. I think injuries to both starting guards took away a strength on the offensive line, and Young has struggled some with turnovers \u2014 four interceptions in his five games. The Panthers were 10th in the league in rushing last year, but they're 23rd this season, which puts more pressure on Young to keep the offense moving.",
      "Aside from Adam Thielen (509 yards, four touchdowns), Young hasn't built much of a connection with his top targets, and the downfield passing game has disappointed. Carolina's 5.5 yards per pass attempt is second-lowest in the NFL, with Young barely ahead of Joe Burrow for the lowest among any QBs with 200-plus yards.",
      "Carolina has turned the playcalling over to Brown, and while he has worked closely with Reich all season, perhaps a fresh perspective there can serve as a spark for the young quarterback.",
      "Ben, did you expect Houston's young receivers to mesh as well as they have with Stroud? Carolina brought in more veterans like Thielen and DJ Chark and tight end Hayden Hurst, while the Texans have gotten five touchdown catches from Nico Collins and Tank Dell, and that's without John Metchie even reaching his full potential.",
      "Arthur: Yeah, the wide receiver play has easily been the biggest surprise early in the season for this promising Texans team. On paper, many league observers (including myself) believed Houston's receiver room was one of the worst in the league. Trading away Brandin Cooks, who had been Houston's No. 1 receiver from 2020-22, didn't help the cause. It didn't look like a cast that would give Stroud a chance for success.\u00a0",
      "Houston's receivers have far exceeded expectations, arguably being the team's most consistent position group this season. Texans wide receivers have 1,236 yards this season, eighth in the NFL, according to Next Gen Stats. Stroud and offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik have been a big reason why, but the receivers deserve plenty of credit for taking advantage of playmaking opportunities.\u00a0",
      "Collins has had injury issues to start his career (he missed 10 games in his first two seasons), but he has been able to stay on the field to this point this season, showing why he was a third-round pick out of Baylor a few years ago. Entering Week 8, he's 10th in the NFL with 547 receiving yards and leads the league with 18.9 yards per reception. Third-round pick Tank Dell, who missed the Texans' Week 7 game with a concussion, has been one of the NFL's best rookie receivers.\u00a0",
      "Greg, how do you envision the Panthers slowing down the Texans' passing attack? How do you see Carolina matching up with Houston overall?\u00a0",
      "Auman: Injuries have really set Carolina's defense back. Corner\u00a0Jaycee Horn, linebacker\u00a0Shaq Thompson, safety\u00a0Jeremy Chinn and edge\u00a0Yetur Gross-Matos are all on injured reserve and others have been sidelined as well.",
      "But any disruption of Stroud has to begin with\u00a0Brian Burns, who has four sacks but only one in the past three games. That has him tied for 23rd in the NFL in sacks, after finishing eighth with 12.5 last season. Stroud has lost two fumbles, which is a potential vulnerability, but the Panthers have zero fumble recoveries in six games, so perhaps not so much so.",
      "If there's an area of concern for Carolina coming off the bye, it's the run defense, giving up 144 yards per game and ranking 31st in the league. Houston's Dameon Pierce is averaging fewer than 3 yards per carry, but Panthers opponents are averaging 4.9 this season, and they're 30th in red-zone defense, giving up touchdowns 75% of the time.",
      "Ben, how good can this Texans team be? With the Titans fading and the Colts playing without Anthony Richardson, they seem to be the best challenger to the Jaguars for the AFC South title. Is that \u2014 or even wild-card contention \u2014 in play for them?",
      "Arthur: The Texans are certainly a playoff contender. The Texans-Jaguars matchup on Nov. 26 is one to circle, with how the seasons of these teams are faring and Houston winning the first showdown in Week 3. I do believe the Jaguars are on the brink of seizing control of the AFC South \u2014 they've won four consecutive games, the league's second-longest active streak \u2014 but the Texans can remain in the wild-card hunt as long as Stroud plays at a high level. They're currently just a half-game behind the Buffalo Bills for the last wild-card spot.\u00a0",
      "How good can the Texans be? I think it depends on the run game. Pierce was supposed to be the engine of the offense, easing Stroud in as the hopeful franchise quarterback. But it's largely been Stroud's play that has overcome deficiencies in the run game to this point. At the start of the season, Houston had the excuse of its offensive line being banged up as the reason the run game couldn't get going. But with the unit upfront growing healthier by the week, albeit with a couple of shuffled parts (standout right tackle Tytus Howard is playing left guard; George Fant at right tackle), the Texans must get consistency out of the ground attack. That's what will make them more competitive when the playoff race heats up down the stretch. The Texans rank 25th with 88.8 rushing yards per game.\u00a0",
      "A positive is that Houston has rushed for more than 120 yards in two of its past three games, and as you pointed out, the Panthers struggle mightily in run defense. That's an area for the Texans to exploit.",
      "That brings me to my final question for you, Greg: What's your score prediction for Texans-Panthers in Charlotte?\u00a0",
      "Auman: It would be huge for Carolina and Young to get their first win in a head-to-head showdown with Houston and Stroud. It's their most winnable game since a matchup with the Vikings a month ago, but I still don't see it happening. The Panthers managed to get more injured over the bye week. I'll take Houston to win on the road and cover, 31-24.",
      "Arthur: I'd have to agree with you, Greg. The Texans are getting healthier, too. Dell, their second-leading receiver, will be back. With Brown taking over playcalling duties for the Panthers, it's hard to know what to expect from Carolina as well. I'll take the Texans 27-21.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "It takes three years for NFL executives, scouts and coaches to determine whether a young player can play at a high level in the league. In theory, three full seasons of NFL practices and games give a player plenty of chances to show his potential while also developing under the watchful eyes of some of the best teachers in the game.",
      "For quarterbacks, it typically takes about 30 career starts to know exactly what you have in a QB1. The significant game reps enable the quarterback to showcase his talents and adjust to opponents tweaking their game plans to neutralize the young player's strengths as a passer-playmaker. Moreover, the time allows the front office and coaches to surround the quarterback with a stellar supporting cast and implement a system that elevates his game.",
      "Reflecting on the 2021 QB class, we have reached the point where we can make strong assessments on whether quarterbacks within this collection have lived up to the hype that preceded their arrival. Most importantly, it is time to determine if the QB1s remaining in the class deserve a lucrative payday that will grant them entrance into the \"$50 Million Club\" that features Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert, Joe Burrow, Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts behind the velvet ropes.",
      "Considering that club inclusion requires a Super Bowl appearance and/or an MVP award or Offensive Player of the Year consideration, the standard has been established for a class of quarterbacks who are eligible for fifth-year options and blockbuster contract extensions.",
      "Let's take a close look at the QB class of 2021.",
      "Trevor Lawrence, Jacksonville Jaguars, No. 1 overall pick",
      "The \"can't-miss\" prospect has lived up to the hype accompanying his game since his emergence as a five-star prospect in high school. Despite stepping into a dysfunctional franchise, Lawrence has developed into a top-10 quarterback since pairing up with Doug Pederson.",
      "The one-time Super Bowl winner and established quarterback-whisperer has unlocked Lawrence's game while transforming Jacksonville into a playoff contender. Lawrence has become a more efficient and effective player as the Jaguars have tweaked the scheme to suit his talents and surrounded him with a veteran collection of pass-catchers with high football IQs and interchangeable games.",
      "With a group of dependable pass-catchers in place, Lawrence has been more willing to throw the ball to spots knowing his receivers will get into the open windows. The third-year pro has improved his completion rate, passer rating and touchdown-to-interception ratio in each of the past two years while flashing big-play ability in clutch moments.",
      "Given the difficulty in finding a quarterback with the capacity to play winning football as a game manager or playmaker, the Jaguars must give Lawrence a ticket to the \"$50 Million Club\" before the price increases in 2024.",
      "Grade: B+",
      "Justin Fields, Chicago Bears, No. 11 overall pick",
      "It has been quite the roller-coaster ride for Fields in the Windy City. The Ohio State product spent his first season playing for a coach (Matt Nagy) who did not appear to have a plan for his game as a dual threat. In addition, the Bears played a veteran (Andy Dalton) with limited upside before giving the ball to Fields in Week 3.",
      "Although injuries cut his rookie season short, Fields flashed enough natural talent, athleticism and playmaking ability to earn the QB1 spot in 2022, with solid results. He notched a 1,000-yard season as a runner and displayed big-play potential with the ball tucked under his arm on designed runs and impromptu scrambles.",
      "While Fields' rushing numbers have been impressive, the third-year pro still struggles with accuracy, timing and ball security. He has been a turnover machine at the position, as evidenced by his 33 fumbles (nine lost). In addition, he has taken 115 sacks due to his hesitancy and indecisiveness within the pocket.",
      "Whether it is Fields' lack of awareness or a poorly constructed scheme that has led to his woes, the inconsistent performance and production have led to questions regarding his long-term future at the position. Given undrafted free agent Tyson Bagent's impressive play as a first-time starter, the Bears might pause before extending their relationship with their up-and-down QB1.\u00a0",
      "Grade: C+",
      "Mac Jones, New England Patriots, No. 15 overall pick",
      "It is hard to replace a legend, particularly when he is a six-time Super Bowl winner for New England and viewed as the G.O.A.T. Jones stepped in admirably as a rookie in 2021, earning Pro Bowl honors while guiding the Patriots to a playoff berth.",
      "His inconsistent play in 2022 and 2023, however, has overshadowed the promising start. Jones' ineffective play under a defensive coordinator-turned-offensive playcaller (Matt Patricia) and a veteran offensive architect (Bill O'Brien) has led to concerns about his upside as the long-term QB1 in New England.",
      "Although Jones has not been surrounded by a stellar supporting cast on the perimeter, the third-year pro's regression has spotlighted Bill Belichick and his inability to win without Tom Brady. The legendary coach with a reputation for building schemes around his players' strengths has been unable to elevate his young quarterback's game. And the offensive stagnation could prompt team owner Robert Kraft to make significant moves at the end of the season.",
      "With Belichick quietly signing a contract extension before the 2023 season, Jones is playing for his job down the stretch.",
      "If Jones continues to struggle with turnovers (31 interceptions) and poor decisions while guiding an offense that lacks pop, the Patriots could move on from the young quarterback in favor of a more talented prospect in the 2024 draft.\u00a0",
      "Grade: C",
      "Zach Wilson, New York Jets, No. 2 overall pick\u00a0",
      "The team's decision to mortgage the farm to acquire a four-time MVP entering the twilight of his career just two years after selecting their young franchise quarterback tells you everything you need to know about the Wilson experiment.",
      "The BYU product has been a major disappointment as a player and leader, and the team entered the trade market to atone for its draft-day mistake. While some of Wilson's struggles can be attributed to an inexperienced playcaller and a leaky offensive line, the young quarterback's lack of accountability and suspect performance forced the Jets to look elsewhere for a QB1 with the leadership skills and game to make the team a viable playoff contender.",
      "Although Aaron Rodgers has helped Wilson become a better player and leader through his mentorship, Wilson must earn the respect of his teammates and coaches by improving his play between the lines. The young gunslinger has started the process with some gritty wins since taking over as the starter, but his teammates will not view him as a legitimate QB1 until he can put the team on his back in a critical moment.",
      "Given Rodgers' expected return in 2024, Wilson needs to make a statement down the stretch to buy some more time as the Jets' quarterback of the future.\u00a0",
      "Grade: D",
      "Trey Lance, Dallas Cowboys, No. 3 overall pick",
      "Despite paying a stiff price to acquire Lance as the quarterback of the future, the San Francisco 49ers did not mind trading him to Dallas following Brock Purdy's emergence as the QB1.",
      "Kyle Shanahan & Co. were ready to move on after watching Lance's hesitant play from the pocket derail an offense loaded with elite talent on the perimeter. Lance's indecisiveness, scattershot accuracy and lack of timing or rhythm make it hard to build an effective passing game around his talents. In addition, his injury history makes it challenging to build a game plan around a player who is routinely unavailable.",
      "Though it is not Lance's fault that injuries have limited his NFL career to just four starts, the questions about his durability will overshadow his potential until he shows the football world that he can play an extended stretch of games without incident. With those concerns added to a list of questions regarding his readiness as a potential NFL starter, Lance has a lot to prove to stay in the league as a quarterback prospect.\u00a0",

      "San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan valued reserve quarterback Sam Darnold enough to allow the USC product to compete for time as the starter this past summer as Brock Purdy worked his way back from elbow surgery.\u00a0",
      "The 49ers signed Darnold to a one-year, $4 million contract during free agency, another sign of how much San Francisco's brass thought of the No. 3 overall selection in the 2018 draft. And with Purdy in concussion protocol and his availability in question for Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Darnold rises to the top of the depth chart.",
      "According to Shanahan, Purdy started experiencing concussion-like symptoms on the plane ride home from Minnesota on Monday and was placed in protocol Tuesday. If Darnold starts on Sunday, he will be the fifth quarterback to take meaningful snaps in the Niners' past 27 games.\u00a0",
      "Darnold, Purdy, Trey Lance and Brandon Allen all got first-team reps in training camp as Shanahan tried to figure out the quarterback room heading into the 2023 season. Darnold had perhaps the most arm talent out of all of them, to go along with the most experience in the league. He appeared to pick up the offense quickly at camp, progressing through his reads and showing an ability to consistently push the ball down the field.",
      "\"I have as much confidence in Sam as I could have with someone that I haven't gone into a real NFL game with,\" Shanahan told reporters this week. \"He was great in the offseason. He's been great here in these seven weeks so far, and he's always ready to go.\u00a0",
      "\"He's been great in the meetings and stuff. He doesn't get many reps, as no backups do, but he does it well on the scout team.\"",
      "During preseason play, Darnold finished 22-of-33 (66.7 %) for 282 passing yards, with two touchdowns and an interception. He was sacked twice and posted a 100.8 passer rating. Darnold has seen a little time with the game already in hand this season, but this would be his first opportunity to play meaningful minutes since joining the 49ers.",
      "The issue for Darnold, now on his third NFL team, has always been taking care of the football.\u00a0",
      "The 26-year-old QB is 21-34 as starter, completing 59.7% of his passes for 11,767 yards, with 61 touchdown passes and 55 interceptions for a so-so 78.2 career passer rating. He's been sacked 148 times in five NFL seasons.\u00a0",
      "Last year, Darnold led the Carolina Panthers to a 4-2 finish in the final six games of the regular season. Now, if Purdy can't play on Sunday, we'll see if he can help the 49ers stop a two-game skid.",

Darnold was sacked four times, posting a 71.4 passer rating in a 22-6 New York loss in Week 13 that season.\u00a0",
      "Darnold will have more playmakers on offense this time, led by one of the best playcallers in the game in Shanahan. San Francisco's \"system quarterback\" offense will once again be under scrutiny if Darnold gets the start.",
      "Jordyn Brooks, Seahawks\u00a0",
      "A year removed from major knee surgery, Brooks had perhaps his best game of the year last weekend. The 26-year-old linebacker recorded nine combined tackles \u2014 including three tackles for loss \u2014 half a sack and a pass break up in Seattle's 20-10 victory over the Arizona Cardinals.",
      "\"Jordan was great,\" fellow linebacker Bobby Wagner said this week. \"He was a little frustrated in the first half of how it went, but he was able to lock in and make some really key plays. And then you saw the emotion. Every time he made a play, it was more and more emotion.\"\u00a0",

    "paragraphs": [
      "Myles Garrett on Sunday was a one-man wrecking ball, adding to his reputation as one of the best defensive players in football.\u00a0",
      "The Browns' All-Pro edge rusher had nine tackles, two sacks, two forced fumbles, a pass breakup and a blocked field goal in Cleveland's dramatic 39-38 victory over the Colts (3-4) at Lucas Oil Stadium. It was nothing less than one of the most dominant individual defensive performances in the NFL this season.\u00a0",
      "He put on his back a Cleveland team (4-2) that didn't play to its elite standard defensively \u2014 38 points is by far the most the Browns have allowed this season \u2014 and was down to its backup quarterback, P.J. Walker, for more than three quarters. Starter Deshaun Watson left the game late in the first period after the back of his head slammed against the turf after a hard hit. He was cleared to return, but coach Kevin Stefanski decided to hold out Watson for the rest of the game.\u00a0",
      "\"Man, 95 is a problem. That's for sure,\" Walker said about Garrett. \"You can see them rally around him, you know what I'm saying? He makes big plays when the biggest plays need to be made and that's big for us.\"\u00a0",
      "The Garrett show began late in the first quarter, when the four-time Pro Bowler beat Colts left tackle Bernhard Raimann on the edge and strip sacked Gardner Minshew on a first-and-10 in Indianapolis territory. The loose ball was recovered by linebacker Anthony Walker Jr. Cleveland scored a touchdown five plays later.\u00a0",
      "Garrett had his second strip sack in the second quarter, with the Colts in the shadow of their own end zone. Indianapolis brought a chipping tight end \u2014 second-year pro Drew Ogletree \u2014 but it didn't matter.\u00a0Garrett got past Olgetree and rookie offensive tackle Blake Freeland, who barely got a hand on him, en route to a sack on Minshew in the end zone just as the QB was trying to push the ball forward. Linebacker Tony Fields II dived on the loose ball, securing it for the touchdown.\u00a0",
      "\"I think you go into every game with Myles anticipating you're going to like your matchups,\" Stefanski said. \"He gets a ton of attention, and when he doesn't get attention \u2014 when he doesn't get that chip or that running back to his side \u2014 he can make a play.\"\u00a0",
      "Nowhere was Garrett's freakish athleticism more present than with 10:16 before halftime, when he blocked a 60-yard field goal by place kicker Matt Gay \u2014 jumping over blocking linemen on the left side of the line of scrimmage once the ball was snapped, and timing his second jump to get his hands up to deflect the kick.\u00a0",
      "Cornerback Denzel Ward corralled the ball, returning it 19 yards to set up the Browns just outside of the red zone at the Colts 26. Cleveland's Dustin Hopkins drilled a 44-yard field goal four plays later.\u00a0",
      "\"Guys have done that before,\" Stefanski said of the blocked field goal. \"(Special teams coordinator Bubba Ventrone) thought there was something there and Myles did a great job. Really got to be careful not to leverage. If there's anyone on earth that can do it, it's Myles Garrett.\"\u00a0",
      "Not only was Garrett wrecking the Colts' game plan, but he's also directly responsible for 17 of the Browns' 39 points in their nail-biting victory, which was secured with a 12-play, 80-yard drive in the closing minutes. With Cleveland out of timeouts, running back Kareem Hunt punched in a fourth-and-goal touchdown run with 15 seconds left.\u00a0",
      "With his first-quarter sack, Garrett surpassed Pro Football Hall-of-Famer Reggie White for the most sacks by a player before turning 28 since 1982, when individual sacks became an official stat, according to NFL Research. White was at 80; Garrett \u2014 who doesn't turn 28 until Dec. 29 \u2014 is now at 82 following Sunday's performance.",

      "The Browns defense, which entered the game playing at a historic level \u2014 the unit had allowed the third-fewest yards by any NFL team in its first five games since 1970 \u2014 was uncharacteristically sloppy and undisciplined at times Sunday. There was the 59-yard catch-and-run touchdown allowed to Colts rookie Josh Downs on a free play. There were the missed tackles on Michael Pittman Jr.'s 75-yard touchdown late in the final period.\u00a0",
      "But we also saw the unit's greatness. How the Browns took the ball away from Minshew, who had four giveaways (three lost fumbles, an interception). How 10 of the Colts' 16 drives were held to three plays or fewer. How the defense can carry a team that is still trying to figure it out offensively.\u00a0",

    "paragraphs": [
      "NEW YORK \u2014 The scouting report sounded strikingly similar to the one that described Ben Simmons when he was an All-Star in Philadelphia, not a backup in Brooklyn.",
      "\"I'm still fast, I can still jump high, I'm still strong,\" Simmons said.",
      "Not last season.",
      "Not when he was so ineffective in his return from back surgery that Simmons couldn't even protest much when he was bounced first from his normal position, then eventually from Nets coach Jacque Vaughn's rotation entirely.",
      "\"It's hard for a coach to really trust and believe in you when he's not seeing it, right?\" Simmons said. \"And I'm not able to physically do it and he can't see it, then as a coach I would do the same thing: \u2018Well, I'm not going to play you if you're not able to compete and do the things I know you can do.'\"",
      "Simmons' relationship with Vaughn has healed and it appears his body has, too.",
      "Reinstalled as the point guard, Simmons was moving quickly and decisively again in the preseason after playing just 42 games the last two seasons. It gives the Nets hope that, no longer with Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving, at least they now have the old Ben Simmons.",
      "\"He looks in shape, he looks confident and pretty aggressive, and it looks like they've got a package of stuff in for him,\" 76ers coach Nick Nurse said.",
      "That was apparent right away in the Nets' exhibition schedule, when Simmons powered past LeBron James on a drive into the lane for a basket early in their opening game against the Lakers in Las Vegas.",
      "If Simmons can keep it up when the games count, Brooklyn will have a player like few others in the NBA, a 6-foot-10 point guard who is quick enough to blow by most players on offense and strong enough to guard any position on defense.",
      "\"Ben Simmons going downhill is a problem,\" said Doc Rivers, who coached Simmons in Philadelphia and is now an ESPN analyst.",
      "But if the Nets get the Simmons of the last two seasons, when at first he didn't play because of mental health reasons and then couldn't play because of physical ones, they will be stuck with a player who is owed more than $78 million over the next two years and is just 5 for 36 in his career from 3-point range, having never developed the jump shot he might need if some athleticism has been lost.",
      "\"He has to have his burst back. And that's the only thing I wonder, is if he can have that,\" Rivers said. \"If he can't have that, then he has to create another way of playing and that is going to be hard.\"",
      "It certainly didn't work last season, when the No. 1 pick in the 2016 draft averaged career lows of 6.9 points, 6.3 rebounds and 6.1 assists. Twice voted to the All-Defensive first team, Simmons also was affected on that end of the floor, fouling out of two of the first three games as his body no longer kept up with his instincts.",
      "Simmons had undergone a microdiscectomy, a procedure to remove a small fragment of a herniated disc, in May 2022. While playing his way back into shape following that, Simmons also developed knee and calf pain that forced him to sit out 20 games last season before a nerve impingement in his back ultimately ended his season in March.",
      "Vaughn, who replaced the fired Steve Nash in November, had decided before then he could no longer wait on Simmons. The Nets were trying to win games and hold onto a playoff spot while overhauling the lineup after dealing Durant and Irving before the trade deadline, and Simmons wasn't performing the way Vaughn needed.",
      "It wasn't until they talked this summer, away from the stress of the season, that Vaughn realized it was because Simmons couldn't, not that he wouldn't.",
      "\"Not like we hadn't talked about it before, but like I said, during the year I had a standard for everyone and that wasn't going to change,\" Vaughn said. \"And so it was hard for me to recalibrate what I was asking of an athlete, when I had seen him before do the things that I was asking.\"",
      "Vaughn went to watch Simmons work out in Miami and both men say their relationship is better now. Vaughn assured Simmons, who played as a forward or backup big man last season, that the ball would be back in hands if he could physically handle it.",
      "\"So the time, which a lot of times heals a lot of things, ended up healing a lot of uncertainty with Ben and I,\" Vaughn said.",
      "Rivers, who compares Simmons to Magic Johnson because of his size and passing ability, thinks a fourth All-Star selection is possible. Simmons, used to his game being scrutinized in both his NBA homes, won't say much beyond that he is finally healthy again.",
      "\"I'm not one to really talk too much in terms of media and things like that when it's not needed,\" Simmons said. \"So it's fun to just come out here and play my game and let everyone else do the talking.\"",

      "LeBron James is keeping receipts.",
      "Dillon Brooks' trash talk? Michael Malone's jabs? Even though James has mostly taken the high road when poked throughout his illustrious 21-season career, apparently that's an ephemeral luxury that has been afforded to his doubters.\u00a0",
      "In fact, James revealed that he plans to respond.\u00a0",
      "\"There will be a time,\" James said at Lakers practice Saturday, flashing a smile. \"When that time is? I don't know. I don't know if it's now or \u2014 there will be a time. There will be a time when everybody will get it, for sure.\"",
      "That's interesting, especially considering James is about to face one of his most recent so-called detractors when the Lakers play the Denver Nuggets in their season opener Tuesday.",
      "Malone, who coached the Nuggets to the franchise's first championship in June, didn't hide his annoyance when James stole the headlines by alluding to retirement after the Nuggets swept the Lakers in the Western Conference finals.",
      "Malone went on to jokingly mock James, saying, \"I'm thinking about retiring\" in an appearance on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" on June 14.",
      "James never explicitly responded to Malone, though he seemingly addressed him in an Instagram post in June.",
      "\"In Europe for the last past few weeks minding my business and I hear I'm on your mind that much huh???\" James wrote. \"I mean I guess I see why. ... Enjoy your light but just know I'm the SUN.\"",
      "The drama doesn't end there.",
      "Some people within the Nuggets' camp believe James purposely alluded to retirement as a tactic to distract from his team's elimination, a source told FOX Sports.",
      "For context, James, who is now the oldest active player in the league, made the possible retirement comments after a 40-point, 10-rebound, nine-assist performance in Game 4. And this came after he helped transform the Lakers from a 2-10 start to reaching the penultimate round of the playoffs.",
      "But Charles Barkley has long believed that James did not make the retirement comments out of exhaustion.",
      "\"I love LeBron, but he knew what he was doing,\" Barkley said on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" in May. \"\u2026 I don't think he should have said anything about [retirement]. I was very disappointed.\"",
      "While James has never publicly addressed that narrative, he made it clear that he doesn't have any extra motivation heading into Tuesday's game against the Nuggets.",
      "\"I don't get motivated against the opponents pretty much anymore,\" said James. \"I don't need it. I don't want to say I don't get motivated to play, because I do get motivated to go against the competition. I love competing against the best. But I don't need an individual or a team to motivate me. I'm self-motivated. I'm enough.\"",
      "This much is for sure: James and the Lakers were very much on the Nuggets' minds, even after they made history by hoisting the Larry O'Brien trophy.",
      "At the Nuggets' championship parade, Malone wore a t-shirt with the words \"Put that in your pipe and smoke it,\" a nod to when he expressed frustration that the Lakers were dominating the headlines despite the Nuggets dominating the teams' series.",
      "And when Malone was introduced to the adoring parade crowd, Altitude TV host Vic Lombardi piled on, saying, \"He came into this world as the son of a coach, but in these playoffs, he became the Lakers' daddy!\"",
      "James, who is widely considered the face of the NBA, is used to both himself and his team being dragged through the mud a bit.",
      "That was on display throughout the playoffs, starting with the Lakers' first-round series against the Memphis Grizzlies. At the time, Brooks called James \"old,\" adding, \"I poke bears. I don't respect anyone until they come and give me 40 [points].\"",
      "James, a four-time NBA champion and four-time MVP, stayed above the fray, all but refusing to take the bait from a player who has never even made an All-Star team. Though, he eventually posted lyrics on Instagram from Jay-Z's song, \"Trouble,\" which many believed was pointed at Brooks.",
      "All in all, Lakers coach Darvin Ham marveled at how James has conducted himself through it all.",
      "\"I think he's handled it like a champ, the champ he is,\" Ham said. \"People say what they want to say. Their actions speak louder than words. And we all know the actions he's had for over the last two decades.\"",
      "For James, apparently the time will come when he fires back at it all.",
      "But until then, he once again took the high road when discussing the Nuggets ahead of their intriguing matchup.",
      "\"They were a better team,\" he said. \"And they won.\"",

    "paragraphs": [
      "James Harden vowed he would never play for a franchise run by 76ers team president Daryl Morey.",
      "The Sixers learned Harden really may stick to his word, after the disgruntled guard skipped Philadelphia's entire preseason slate in the wake of his trade demand. Harden \u2014 officially away because of a personal matter \u2014 did not practice with the Sixers this week and the three-time NBA scoring champion was not at the Wells Fargo Center on Friday night for the finale against Atlanta.",
      "Harden's No. 1 jersey still hung at the arena -- only on sale at team stores for $139.",
      "The Sixers are set to open their season Thursday against Milwaukee. They play at Toronto before the Oct. 29 home opener against Portland. Coach Nick Nurse, in his first season after five years with Toronto, is preparing for games without Harden.",
      "\"I think I've been preparing for it all this week, for sure,\" Nurse said Friday. \"Lots of thought has gone into him not playing and preparing the team that way this summer. I keep saying, there is another plan if something changes. I don't think it's affected us very much, at all. We've just gone out and played and we're going to have to go out play the way we're trying to play. I think that is without (him) until something changes.\"",
      "Harden and the 76ers are no strangers to turmoil. Harden's wildly successful tenure in Houston -- where he first teamed with Morey, then the general manager -- included the scoring titles and 2018 NBA MVP award. But his relationship with Houston eventually soured and he forced his way to Brooklyn in 2021. He joined Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and formed a Big 3 that was never very big. The trio was socked by injuries and other controversies (notably, Irving's stance on the COVID-19 vaccine) and they played only 18 games together before, yup, Harden wanted out.",
      "So it was off to Philly at the 2022 trade deadline, where he was reunited with Morey and seemed comfortable in his role as a playmaker while the offense ran through Joel Embiid. Harden even declined in June 2022 his $47.4 million option, saying he wanted to give the 76ers flexibility to improve their roster and compete for a championship. He signed a deal worth slightly over $68 million, paying him about $33 million last season with a $35 million player option for this season.",
      "The Sixers were able to sign P.J. Tucker to the full mid-level exception and Danuel House to the bi-annual exception because Harden declined his option. Both players are still on the Sixers.",
      "Here's where circumstances get tricky. Part of Harden's complaint stems from his belief he should have earned a long-term contract with the Sixers after last season. It never came, thus the trade demand. Harden could have declined the option and decided to try for free agency. The player known as The Beard instead picked up his $35.6 million option with the 76ers for this season, with the desire to force a trade. Harden preferred a trade to the Los Angeles Clippers but those talks \u2014 and talks with other teams \u2014 went nowhere.",
      "Harden unloaded on Morey at an August promotional event in China.",
      "\"Daryl Morey is a liar and I will never be a part of an organization that he's a part of,\" Harden said at the event. \"Let me say that again: Daryl Morey is a liar and I will never be a part of an organization that he's a part of.\"",
      "The NBA fined Harden $100,000 for his comments. The league talked to Harden as part of its investigation and confirmed that his comments referenced his belief that the 76ers would not grant his trade request.",
      "In large part to not violate parts of his contract that could affect free agency under the Collective Bargaining Agreement and to show he's ready to play should he get traded to the Clippers, Harden eventually showed up late to training camp and did practice with the 76ers at their New Jersey complex. He later said he lost trust in Morey.",
      "\"I wanted to be here and retire a Sixer, and the front office didn't have that in their future plans,\" Harden said last week. \"It's literally out of my control. It's something I didn't want to happen to be in this position.\"",
      "Nurse said it wasn't a waste of time \u2014 \"it's cool\" \u2014 to even bother to practice this preseason with Harden in attendance.",
      "Now Nurse, Morey, Embiid and the rest of the Sixers are set to navigate a season \u2014 which more or less hinges on the outcome of the Harden situation \u2014 with the promise of more off-court theatrics ahead.",
      "\"There really doesn't feel like there's a need to address anything,\" Nurse said Friday. \"Listen, if you're not fully aware of what's going on ... I think you're probably asleep a lot or something.\"",

    "paragraphs": [
      "What have we learned thus far in Week 7? FOX Sports' staff of NFL writers joined forces to deliver insight and analysis from around the league.\u00a0",
      "In this weekly story, we'll tell you what we noticed, what we heard and what to keep an eye on next.",
      "Lamar Jackson is a worthy MVP candidate",
      "Lions vs. Ravens was one of the best matchups going into the weekend. It was a letdown \u2014 because Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens utterly and completely dominated one of the NFC's best teams.",
      "The Ravens led 28-0 at halftime They amassed 503 total yards on just 55 offensive plays. That's an average gain of 9.1. Jackson was absolutely electric, and perhaps the only interesting part of the game. The way he extended plays for 10 seconds or more despite players like Aidan Hutchinson bearing down on him was awe-inspiring.\u00a0",
      "The Ravens offensive line held together, too, and Baltimore actually included Jackson more in the run game than it had prior to this week, and yet he still finished with 21 completions on 27 pass attempts for 357 yards and three touchdowns. That was good for a near-perfect passer rating of 155.3 and outpaced his previous single-game high this season by more than 100 passing yards. That should qualify him for all the passing awards this week. Jackson also averaged four yards per carry on the ground and added a rushing touchdown for good measure.",
      "What he did against one of the league's best defenses outperforms any game he had during his 2019 MVP season. The only game that year he came close to 357 yards passing was in Week 1 against Miami and he rushed for only six total yards. Jackson has been steadily improving as a passer and now under Todd Monken, things seemed to have clicked. Jackson is now pushing the ball down the field at an incredibly efficient rate while maintaining the skill set that makes him special on the ground.\u00a0",
      "He doesn't just belong in the MVP conversation, but atop it at this point. \u2014Carmen Vitali\u00a0",
      "Raiders, Davante Adams still struggling \u2014 but they may be stuck with each other",
      "More passes to Davante Adams didn't yield a win for the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday.",
      "Adams wasn't happy with his usage before this week's game. He was then targeted seven times in the first quarter and 12 times total, resulting in seven catches for 57 yards in the Raiders' loss to the Bears on Sunday. One potential touchdown pass went off his hands in the end zone.",
      "\"To put this to bed, like, we always try to get the ball to our best guys,\" Raiders coach Josh McDaniels said after the loss. \"And sometimes the defense plays things and takes that opportunity away. Just so happened there was a handful of things early in the game that we had opportunities to go ahead and get to them, and they played defenses and didn't double team. [The Bears] got off to a decent start, and they started to do some things with the coverage, and again, we got to play the game more on early downs.\"",
      "Adams, who led the NFL with 14 touchdown receptions last year, has just three this season after seven games, and he made comments this week saying that he sets the bar high for his individual success.",
      "\"When you're a player like me, mentally my benchmark is not wins and losses, it's greatness,\" Adams said this week. \"So when I go out there, I expect to be able to have that ability, to put that on tape and have an influence on the game. ... That's my purpose for being here. I came here to win and to do it the right way.\"",
      "Las Vegas is 3-4, three games behind the Chiefs in the AFC West and likely competing for a wild-card spot. After moving on from longtime starter Derek Carr in the offseason, the Raiders have already played three quarterbacks this season due to injuries to starter Jimmy Garoppolo.",
      "Adams owned his end-zone drop Sunday after the game.",
      "\"I should have made that play,\" he said. \"I mean, I killed whoever that was out there [on defense] and then just didn't make it.\"",
      "Adams had gone through back-to-back quiet weeks, combining for six catches on nine targets against the Patriots and Packers, but a heavier dose of him wasn't enough to get the Raiders to a third straight win Sunday. He'll have a big spotlight on him for his next game, as the Raiders face the Lions on Monday night, with Detroit coming off a surprising 38-6 loss to the Ravens on Sunday.",
      "And the presence of an unhappy superstar on a team with a losing record can make you wonder if Adams could be traded before next week's deadline. ESPN reported this week, however, that Las Vegas won't be trading him. And logistically, dealing Adams now would result in $8 million in dead money against this year's cap and $23.6 million against next year's cap, so it isn't ideal for the Raiders. \u2014Greg Auman",
      "How many pass-catchers are as valuable to their teams as Travis Kelce is to the Chiefs?",
      "Let's talk about Taylor Swift.",
      "I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Stick with me.",
      "Let's talk about Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. He finished Sunday's win over the Chargers with 12 catches, 179 yards and a touchdown. It's just one of the many great games during his prolific career.",
      "\"He's a special player,\" quarterback Patrick Mahomes told NFL Network after the game. \"The way he understands the game, the way he understands coverages and gets himself open \u2014 it's special.\"",
      "This season, Kelce has proven he's right up there with receiver Tyreek Hill as one of the most valuable playmakers in the NFL. The Chiefs, over the past two years, have not invested in their receiver position in part because they seem to think they can just make things work with Mahomes and Kelce. And so far, so good.",
      "While Hill is probably the league MVP among non-QBs, Kelce has to be an easy No. 2 over the likes of Justin Jefferson and Christian McCaffrey. Unlike the Vikings and the 49ers, the Chiefs just don't have a single other skill players they can count on. You can really tell Mahomes is lifting the production of his receiving group.",
      "Even in an underwhelming group of pass-catchers, Kelce is on pace to have his seventh consecutive 1,000-yard season, further cementing him as the best receiving tight end in the history of the game. It helps to have Patrick Mahomes. But Rob Gronkowski was lucky to have Tom Brady. Antonio Gates had Philip Rivers. Every truly great tight end needs a quarterback.",
      "But even in New England, Gronk didn't have to deal with this dearth of support that Kelce is managing in Kansas City over these past two years. There were some low years for the Patriots, but Gronk always had Wes Welker or Julian Edelman to lighten the load. For the past two years, Kelce has essentially stood alone among Chiefs pass-catchers.",
      "And during that span, he has averaged 6.6 catches, 76.5 yards and .7 touchdowns per game. In the past two games, he has averaged 10.5 receptions and 151.5 yards (with one touchdown total during that span).\u00a0",
      "Forget about tight end: Kelce is one of the best skill-position players of his generation. \u2014Henry McKenna",
      "How the Patriots revived Mac Jones against the NFL's best pass-rush",
      "It was just one game, but Mac Jones looked like a younger version of himself on Sunday.",
      "In a 29-25 win over the Buffalo Bills, the New England Patriots' third-year quarterback demonstrated a competence and confidence that he has lacked since his rookie season. And this had been such a rough run for Jones that I was among those beginning to wonder whether it was a matter of when \u2014 not if \u2014 Jones would be a former Patriots quarterback.",
      "Jones was solid on Sunday. He didn't do anything special, but he avoided the turnover issues that have plagued him this season \u2014 a total of seven interceptions and two fumbles. This was his second turnover-free game of the season.",
      "Jones was 25-of-30 for 272 yards and two touchdowns.",
      "But the lack of turnovers and the touchdowns and the completions weren't the only indicators that Jones got right. He also managed to pull off a comeback drive. It wasn't technically a fourth-quarter comeback, because the Patriots were leading when the fourth quarter began. But Jones led a go-ahead drive that culminated with a TD pass with 12 seconds left.",
      "On that drive, he was 6-of-7 for 64 yards.",
      "How did it all come together?",
      "\"[Bill] O'Brien,\" Jones told NFL Network after the game. \"He did a great job calling a good game and being aggressive and using things that I did in college that I really liked. So I really appreciate that.\"",
      "With the Patriots facing the NFL's best pass rush, New England made heavy use of the quick passing game, with Jones checking the ball down to his running backs. His average depth of target was just 3.3 yards. And there was an adjustment to the personnel, with the Patriots playing more of Demario Douglas, Kendrick Bourne and Jalen Reagor over DeVante Parker. JuJu Smith-Schuster was also out with a concussion.",
      "Bourne and Douglas delivered the yards after the catch that this offense badly needed. It was enough to make you wonder whether the Patriots might let Mac cook.",
      "\"It's just a crumb. And just keep picking up those crumbs and eventually you'll have a whole loaf of bread,\" Jones said after the game.",
      "Before the Patriots let Mac cook, we're going to have to teach him how to bake. That's not how it works, my friend.",
      "But I can't make too much fun of him. Because then I'll have to answer to Mike Gesicki, who had a word for Jones' critics.",
      "\"I don't think a lot of the talk and stuff that happens with him is fair, honestly,\" Gesicki said. \"I think he's done an unbelievable job kind of blocking all of that out, and he's done an unbelievable job internally leading us throughout all that adversity.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether Jones' baking and quarterback talents can be salvaged. But he took a step in the right direction. And maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 Jones can play his way back into the picture as the Patriots evaluate who they might have at quarterback in the years to come. \u2014McKenna",
      "What\u2019s up with LaFleur and Love?",
      "I\u2019m going to borrow a phrase from former Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers: R-E-L-A-X.",
      "Yes, the Green Bay offense has looked completely uninspired lately, especially after a 19-17 loss to the Denver Broncos. Even parts of the offense that were supposed to be reliable (the offensive line and backfield) don\u2019t look well-seasoned. Head coach Matt LaFleur looks like an average playcaller at best right now. Jordan Love is inconsistent, to put it mildly.",
      "If there\u2019s one thing Packers fans aren\u2019t used to, it\u2019s subpar offense.",
      "But this comes with the territory of having a young quarterback. I know it was 15 years ago that Green Bay welcomed a new starter under center but six games isn\u2019t nearly enough of a sample size to determine if a player is going to be successful. Progress isn\u2019t linear.\u00a0",
      "It doesn\u2019t look like LaFleur entirely trusts Love yet. That\u2019s OK. Love makes some questionable decisions, like going for a touchdown on third-and-20 from the Packers\u2019 46-yard line instead of just getting the first down. But think about who Love\u2019s mentor was. Think about what Rodgers would do in those situations. He went for it all. But he had the experience to make that call. Love doesn\u2019t yet.",
      "Former backup quarterback Kurt Benkert wrote a great thread about this on Monday.",
      "Not only does Love lack the experience, but his receivers don\u2019t either. That last play of the game for Green Bay was textbook for drawing a DPI, which has as high a chance at success than any other play on third-and-20. But the receiver didn\u2019t sell it. In those situations, Love should have absolutely gone for the first-down play, which was built into the play call, but he watched his predecessor succeed taking risks.",
      "So Love just needs more experience before we write him off. He certainly needs more than six games\u2019 worth. LaFleur needs to get used to what Love can and can\u2019t do, which is continually evolving. And Love needs to get used to his receivers.",
      "But what we\u2019re not going to do is make a judgment call on either LaFleur or Love based on six games. Welcome to the reality of life with a young quarterback, Packers fans. It\u2019s been a while. \u2014Vitali",
      "Devon Witherspoon's physicality evokes Legion of Boom vibes",
      "On a bone-rattling tackle of Cardinals receiver Rondale Moore, Seattle Seahawks cornerback Devon Witherspoon showed what could eventually make him a top-flight NFL defensive player.",
      "Covering Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown on the perimeter in the third quarter of his team's Week 7, 20-10 win over the Cardinals, Witherspoon quickly diagnosed an out route to the slot receiver from Arizona's 14-yard line.",
      "Eyeing quarterback Joshua Dobbs, Witherspoon came off his man and put Moore on his back on a hit that brought out \"oohs\" from the home crowd at Lumen Field.",
      "Witherspoon was known as a fierce hitter entering the draft this year out of Illinois. But at 5-foot-11 and 185 pounds, his ability to create explosive hits, considering his relatively small frame, has been reminiscent of another Seattle defensive back who delivered big hits in a smaller package \u2013 former Seahawks Pro Bowl safety Earl Thomas.",
      "Witherspoon finished with four combined tackles and a pass breakup against Arizona. But he also had two game-wrecking plays erased \u2014 a sack negated because of an illegal contact call on cornerback Tariq Woolen and an interception in the end zone brought back because of a roughing the passer call on edge rusher Boye Mafe.",
      "Seattle coach Pete Carroll says that Witherspoon is playing exactly how he expected when the Seahawks selected him with the No. 5 overall pick in this year's draft.",
      "\"You know he's out there,\" Carroll told reporters. \"He's really an exciting young player.\"",
      "Added Seahawks safety Jamal Adams, who finished with six combined tackles: \"He's one of the smartest rookies I've ever been around. Obviously, a complete baller. He's a game changer. He can do it all. That's my guy.\"",
      "The addition of Witherspoon allows Seattle to play smaller bodies in order to better defend the pass while still being solid against the run. Per Next Gen Stats, the Seahawks have played at least five defensive backs on 88% of their plays this season, compared to 72% last season.",
      "Despite the use of more defensive backs, the Seahawks allow just 3.49 yards per rush, No. 3 in the NFL. Hard hitters and sure tacklers like Witherspoon and Adams are helping Seattle create more versatility in their sub-packages on that side of the ball this season. \u2014Eric D. Williams",
      "Frustration bubbles over in Washington with \"same old\" Commanders",
      "The good vibes in Washington from the sale of the franchise to billionaire Josh Harris are mostly long gone. The fan base might be reinvigorated and the future might be bright. But frustration is cumulative.",
      "And there's a lot of it in Washington right now.",
      "Just ask defensive tackle Jonathan Allen, who let it all out in an interview after the Commanders' 14-7 loss to the lowly Giants on Sunday.",
      "\"I'm f\u2014king tired of this shit,\" Allen said. \"F\u2014king tired of this bulls\u2014. It's been seven f\u2014king years of the same s\u2014. I'm tired of this s\u2014.\"",
      "Allen has yet to experience a winning season during his seven-year tenure in Washington, and with the Commanders at 3-4 heading into a game against the Philadelphia Eagles next Sunday, this one isn't trending in the right direction either. And he's not the only one who is feeling the frustration. The new ownership group feels it, too.",
      "Just ask Magic Johnson, a limited partner, who tweeted this after the game: \"Disappointing 14-7 loss for my Commanders to the NY Giants. It's hard to win in the NFL when you only score 7 points.\"",
      "And that was nothing compared to what he tweeted two weeks ago after a 40-20 loss to the Chicago Bears, when he ripped into the Commanders, saying they \"played with no intensity or fire.\"",
      "If Magic noticed, you can bet Harris did, too. And if they're disappointed, that surely doesn't bode well for Ron Rivera and GM Martin Mayhew. They were in a tough spot to begin with this season. Though Harris was never specific, it seemed clear they needed to show him why they should keep their jobs.",
      "But again, frustration is cumulative. They are saddled with seven years, as Allen said, of \"the same s\u2014.\"",
      "It's getting harder to imagine the new bosses won't decide the only way to clean it all up is to shovel everything out. \u2014Ralph Vacchiano",
      "No deal: Giants tell Saquon he's not going anywhere at the trade deadline",
      "Saquon Barkley is not on the trading block. But does that mean he's in the Giants' long-term plans?",
      "That's hard to say, but he's in their plans for at least the rest of the season \u2014 or at least that's what Barkley told reporters that he was told by Giants coach Brian Daboll and GM Joe Schoen. He said he was assured that the Giants have no plans to deal him before the trade deadline on Oct. 31, which is good news for him since he didn't want to be traded anyway.",
      "It does make some sense. Despite the Giants' miserable start (2-5), they are only 1.5 games out of the last playoff spot in the NFC with a long 10 games still to go. They probably need to finish at least 7-3, which seems unlikely, but they're close enough that trading their best player probably doesn't make sense.",
      "They also still have the option of using the franchise tag on Barkley again in 2024 or signing him to a long-term contract. But they couldn't get a deal done in the offseason and it's hard to imagine they'd be willing to up their offer now, especially after watching the oft-injured Barkley miss three games with a high ankle sprain.",
      "But Barkley could have been a valuable chip in a market where many teams are nursing injuries to their top running backs. Barkley is healthy again, despite hyperextending his left elbow in the Giants' 14-7 win over Washington Sunday. And he showed his value by combining for 118 total yards, including 77 rushing.",
      "The Giants, though, remain committed to him for at least another 10 games, so he can help them salvage whatever is left of this disappointing season. After that, they've always said they'd like him to remain a Giant long-term. But there's still only so far they're willing to go to make that happen. \u2014Vacchiano",
      "Jonathan Taylor looks like \u2026 Jonathan Taylor\u00a0",
      "To understand where Jonathan Taylor is with the Colts, look no further than Indianapolis' third-quarter touchdown drive in Sunday's heartbreaking loss to Cleveland.\u00a0",
      "On that drive, coach Shane Steichen called Taylor's number incessantly. The former All-Pro running back touched the ball on seven straight plays \u2014 six carries, plus a 20-yard screen pass \u2014 en route to his five-yard touchdown run. That possession was the biggest highlight in what was by far Taylor's best performance of the season: 120 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown. He had 18 carries for 75 yards (4.2 yards per carry) and three receptions on four targets for 45 yards (15 yards per catch).\u00a0",
      "The performance showed the NFL world that Taylor is getting back to his pre-injury self. We saw spurts of his impressive cutback ability and second-gear speed.\u00a0",
      "With arguably the best backup running back in the league in Zack Moss, the Colts have the luxury of easing Taylor back in after he missed all of training camp and was out the first four games of the season on PUP. But with the way Taylor played in Week 7, it might be time to let him loose. It might be time to let him carry the Colts as he did in 2021, when he was the league's triple-crown rushing champion.\u00a0",
      "That would take pressure off backup quarterback Gardner Minshew, the starter for the rest of the season with No. 4 overall pick Anthony Richardson done for the season. Minshew has eight turnovers in the past two games (four interceptions, four lost fumbles).\u00a0",
      "Against the Browns, Taylor split offensive snaps 50-50 with Moss. That was up from 42% the previous week and 15% two weeks ago, when he made his season debut. \u2014Ben Arthur\u00a0",
      "Trevor Lawrence's toughness",
      "Trevor Lawrence's ascent as a franchise quarterback hasn't been rapid by any means. It's been very gradual: Results didn't really start manifesting \u2014 consistently \u2014 until the second half of last season, his second year in the NFL.\u00a0",
      "I think that methodical rise took another step last week, in the Jaguars' 31-24 victory in New Orleans on Thursday Night Football. He battled his first-ever knee injury at any level \u2014 a left knee sprain suffered the week prior against Indianapolis \u2014 that threatened to sideline him for the first time in his NFL career.\u00a0",
      "Not only did he tough it out, but he also put together an impressive performance: a 69% completion rate for 204 yards and a touchdown with a 100.4 passer rating. The touchdown pass was the game-winner, a 44-yard catch-and-run score by wide receiver Christian Kirk with 3:08 remaining. And with questions about his mobility entering the game, too, Lawrence also had a career-high 59 rushing yards on eight attempts (7.4 yards per carry).\u00a0",
      "Before the game, Lawrence had only lost in New Orleans, too. The Caesar Superdome is where he suffered the only two losses of his three-year career at Clemson. He also lost there his second preseason game as a rookie in 2021. He acknowledged postgame that was one of the reasons he wanted to play despite the injury.\u00a0",
      "\"I've had a bad taste in my mouth every time I've left New Orleans, so it feels good to get a win here,\" he said.\u00a0",
      "Beyond consistent elite performance, franchise quarterbacks must also meet a certain threshold of grit, and Thursday was a testament of Lawrence having that quality. \u2014Arthur\u00a0",

      "Does Tyson Bagent's success validate Bears coaches and put a spotlight on Justin Fields?",
      "It's very important to remember that Sunday's win over the Las Vegas Raiders was one game. Quarterback Justin Fields has a thumb injury on his throwing hand so the Bears turned to their second option: a rookie UDFA out of Division II Shepherd University.\u00a0",
      "It's also very important to remember the ire Bears coaches have drawn this season for not being able to adjust or evolve a successful game plan.",
      "They did that on Sunday for the rookie's first start. Tyson Bagent didn't have to do anything at an outstanding level to pull out a win over a struggling team. He just had to execute the game plan given to him, one his coaches looked comfortable calling.",
      "The Bears spent all week talking about how they didn't need to change much of the offense should Bagent start. Even Bagent talked about his goal of being able to execute whatever plays offensive coordinator Luke Getsy wanted to call. Come Sunday, he did. And then some.",
      "Chicago jumped out to a 14-3 lead by halftime, but if you've watched any Bears football this season, that's not exactly a safe lead. Chicago has especially struggled to maintain a lead or add to it in the second half of games. What the Bears did coming out of halftime was going to be paramount, even against a bad Raiders team.\u00a0",
      "Getsy got on the whiteboard at halftime and drew up some of the plays they were going to run in the second half. On Chicago's first possession, one came to life on a screen that yielded running back D'Onta Foreman 17 yards. The drive ended in a touchdown.",
      "\"The screen is one of them that stands out and I think we couldn't have executed it any better,\" said Bagent after the game. \"That's been on the call sheet for a couple of weeks. For [Getsy] to have the confidence in me, the O-line, everybody to execute \u2014 kind of a high-risk play, when you're throwing the ball back across the field, I thought it was great.\"",
      "So if Bagent was able to execute the game plan enough to win, pared down or otherwise, while also being successful with plays Chicago has wanted to run for weeks but didn't for one reason or another, is it fair to say the inefficiency of the Bears offense is all on the coaching staff or playcaller?",
      "I'm not at all saying Bagent is the future under center. I'm not even saying Justin Fields is the problem. But something about the combination of Fields and this offensive system isn't consistent. If you're able to pare it down for Bagent, you should be able to with Fields. You should be able to adjust. It begs the question of why that's not the case. \u2014Vitali\u00a0",
      "Puka Nacua cementing his status as Offensive Rookie of the Year frontrunner",
      "The targets and receptions keep piling up for Los Angeles Rams rookie receiver Puka Nacua. He led the Rams with eight catches for 154 receiving yards on 12 targets in a 24-17 loss Sunday to the Pittsburgh Steelers at SoFI Stadium.",
      "Nacua now has 58 receptions for 752 yards and two touchdowns, joining Cincinnati Bengals receiver Ja'Marr Chase (754) as the only pass-catchers with 700-plus receiving yards through the first seven games of their NFL careers. Nacua has four 100-yard receiving performances through seven games and is the second favorite to win NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year behind Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud.",
      "At 6-foot-2 and 205 pounds, Nacua's physicality and nimbleness for a guy his size continues to stand out. He came down with an impressive toe-dragging catch along the sideline in the third quarter for a 32-yard reception against double coverage. Three plays later on the same drive, Nacua bowled over a couple would-be Pittsburgh defenders on a drag route for another chunk play, this one for 20 yards.",
      "And Nacua also continues to be a force in the running game as a blocker on the edge, sealing off Pro Bowl defenders like Steelers edge rusher T.J. Watt.",
      "\"I thought Puka did a really nice job today when he got his opportunities,\" Matthew Stafford told reporters after the game. \"We had chances to make plays and when Puka got those chances, he made them, which was great.\"",
      "Stafford and the Rams needed Nacua to play well, as WR1 Cooper Kupp had a rough start, with two drops in the first quarter. Kupp had two drops the entire season last year. On Sunday, he finished with just two receptions for 29 yards on seven targets. \u2014Williams",
      "More offensive firepower in Philly",
      "The rich get richer with the Philadelphia Eagles adding Julio Jones to a wide receiver corps that already features A.J. Brown, De'Vonta Smith, and Dallas Goedert. Although the two-time All-Pro Jones is no longer the dominant playmaker who led the NFL in receiving yards per game three times, he is a crafty WR3 with the size, route-running skill, and hands to thrive in a complementary role on an offense loaded with talent. Jones' experience and expertise will help the Eagles down the stretch when opponents make a concerted to take away Brown and Smith with bracket coverage on key down. With opponents unable to utilize double coverage and load the box, the Eagles should be able to take advantage of the one-on-one coverage on the veteran playmaker on the perimeter.\u00a0",
      "Moreover, the veteran's experience will help the team's dynamic receiving duo grow and evolve as marquee playmakers who are expected to thrive against any defender or coverage tactic employed by their future opponents. \u2014Bucky Brooks",

    "paragraphs": [
      "The 2023-24 NBA season has arrived! The season tips off on Oct. 24 and we here at FOX Sports know that getting reacquainted with the league can be overwhelming.",
      "To help with that, we've put together a preview that will basically tell you everything you need to know by dividing the 30 teams into eight categories:",
      "Here are the 10 teams that will likely be competing for a title this season:",
      "Teams that will be disappointed with anything short of a championship.",
      "DENVER NUGGETS",
      "Reasons to be optimistic: They're bringing back the four best players from the group that won the title last season in Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Oh, and that Jokic guy has proven to be unstoppable. Losing Bruce Brown will hurt, but the Nuggets are high on some of their young reserves like Peyton Watson and Christian Braun. Also, it's worth repeating: Nikola Jokic is unstoppable.",
      "Reasons to be pessimistic: Honestly, it's hard to find any. Remember, not only did they win the title last year, but they went 16-4 in the playoffs. They were so dominant that you have teams like the Lakers (swept) and Timberwolves (lost 4-1) patting themselves on the back for competing. Sure, it's hard to win back-to-back titles (only 12 teams have done so since the NBA-ABA merger), and some of the other teams in this tier have beefed up, but as long as Jokic is healthy, this is very clearly the team to beat.",
      "X-Factor: The Bucks and Suns both added explosive perimeter scorers over the offseason. Both teams will have the ability to punish Jokic's sluggish pick-and-roll defense by putting him in action. If someone does somehow knock off Denver, this will be the recipe.",
      "BOSTON CELTICS",
      "Reasons to be optimistic: A team that won 57 games last season and finished the season with the No. 2 offense and defense essentially traded Marcus Smart and Robert Williams III for Krisptas Porzingis and Jrue Holiday. Those two, alongside Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Derrick White and Al Horford, give the Celtics the most explosive, versatile and talented top-six in the NBA. And Porzingis' ability to post up should add some diversity to the Celtics offense, which should help come playoff time. Also, Joe Mazzulla, after being thrust into the job of head coach days before the start of training camp last season, now has a full season under his belt and had a full offseason to prepare for the job.",
      "Reasons to be pessimistic: Frontline depth could \u2014 and likely will \u2014 be an issue. Porzingis is an injury waiting to happen and Horford is 37 years old. Behind them the top option is Luke Kornet.",
      "X-Factor: Health is the thing that can hold this team back, specifically Porzingis'. If he's on the court come playoff time, this is going to be a hard team to beat.",
      "MILWAUKEE BUCKS",
      "Reasons to be optimistic: A team whose lone weakness was half-court scoring just added one of the premier half-court scorers in the league. Opponents are going to have fits trying to slow down the Damian Lillard-Giannis Antetokounmpo pick-and-roll. Oh, and Khris Middleton is still here, too.",
      "Reasons to be pessimistic: Adrian Griffin was a well-respected assistant coach, but he's a first time head coach, and you never know how someone is going to react to being in that chair. Also, this team is relying a lot on Brook Lopez, who's fantastic, but is also 35 years old.",
      "X-Factor: Trading for Lillard was a no-brainer, but in giving up Holiday the Bucks surrendered their best perimeter defender. Who, come playoff time, is going to guard the dynamic big wings like Jimmy Butler and Jayson Tatum, never mind all those studs out West (Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, LeBron James,\u00a0 Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, etc.)? The guess here is that it's Giannis, but we're yet to see if he has the lateral quickness to handle that gig.\u00a0",
      "PHOENIX SUNS",
      "Reasons to be optimistic: How do you defend a team with three dynamic scorers like Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal? And now they've added one of the league's top defensive minds in head coach Frank Vogel. The Suns also did a nice job filling out the roster with guys like Eric Gordon and the 3-and-D-lite Keita Bates-Diop.\u00a0",
      "Reasons to be pessimistic: The Suns' three players all operate best with the ball in their hands.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
      "X-Factor: Everything in Phoenix is built upon the idea of Durant being this unstoppable force, which he is when he's on the court. The problem is he's not always on the court. He hasn't played more than 55 games in a season since 2020 and the injuries to his lower body are piling up. If Durant's not healthy come playoff time, this team has no chance.",
      "These aren't the betting favorites, but don't be stunned if one of them breaks through.\u00a0",
      "LOS ANGELES LAKERS",
      "Reasons to be optimistic: They still have LeBron James and Anthony Davis. They were 18-7 after the trade deadline last season, when, among others, Russell Westbrook was sent out and D'Angelo Russell,\u00a0 Rui Hachimura and Jarred Vanderbilt were brought in. Part of that had to do with the emergence of Austin Reaves\u2014 when he, LeBron and AD shared the court during the regular season the Lakers outscored opponents by a ridiculous 16.4 points per 100 non-garbage time possessions, according to Cleaning the Glass. The additions of Christian Wood, Taurean Prince and Gabe Vincent should add some nice depth.",
      "Reasons to be pessimistic: Reaves is great, with an uncanny ability to draw fouls, but he's not going to catch anybody off guard this season. Also, they still don't have anyone to match up with Jokic in a playoff series. Maybe that's because there's no one in the NBA who can, but they could use a big body to help AD.",
      "X-Factor: Same as it ever was \u2014 Anthony Davis' health. AD is one of the best defensive players in the league and a force on offense. When he's on the floor, the Lakers are great. When he's not \u2014 which is often the case \u2014 they don't stack up against some of the other top teams in the West.",
      "GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS",
      "Reasons to be optimistic: A team that can seemingly never score when Steph Curry sits (eight points worse per 100 possessions without Curry last season, per NBA Advanced Stats) just added Chris Paul.",
      "Reasons to be pessimistic: Draymond Green will miss the start of the season with an ankle injury \u2014 which is not an ideal start, especially for a team that finished last season 14th in defense.",
      "X-Factor: The Warriors don't have a true center in their rotation \u2014 unless you count the 6'9\" Kevon Looney. That's fine when facing most teams, but not when you're trying to dethrone a player like Jokic. Which brings us back to Chris Paul. This is a team that's going to need to outscore opponents in the playoffs. If Paul can find his legs and figure out a way to fit in here and embrace his role, the Warriors might be able to do just that.",
      "MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES",
      "Reasons to be optimistic: Ja Morant is allowed to practice with the team during his 25-game suspension, which should help ease his return to the lineup. And the presence of talents like Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr. as well as newcomer Marcus Smart should allow the Grizzlies to remain in the Western Conference playoff picture until Morant arrives. And any defense with Smart and Jackson Jr. is going to be a handful to play against.",
      "Reasons to be pessimistic: The West is so deep and so loaded that the difference between the two seed and, say, the 8th could be something like three games. It's not an ideal situation for a team that's going to be missing its best player for at least 25.\u00a0",
      "X-Factor: The Grizzlies have done a nice job building this thing around Morant, but they're going to go as far as Morant takes them. If he returns in good shape and is able to perform at a high level and make basketball a priority then this team has a title shot. If not, they're cooked.",
      "LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS",
      "Reasons to be optimistic: Kawhi Leonard is still here, and still a stud. Same goes for Paul George. So is head coach Ty Lue. The depth isn't what it once was, but the Clipper still have enough as long as their two best players are on the floor. Of course \u2026",
      "Reasons to be pessimistic: \u2026 that's rarely the case. In four seasons on the Clippers, Leonard and George have played just 118 regular season games together. Out of a possible 708. That's 16.7 percent.",
      "X-Factor: The Clippers, aware of this issue, appear to be chasing James Harden. He's far from a perfect solution, but adding him could help protect them from a backslide should George or Leonard miss a chunk of time once again.",
      "[Read more: The Lakers, Clippers and a burner: Behind that fake Austin Reaves-Taylor Swift rumor]",
      "Giving these two teams their own category. Both are very good win-now groups who will win lots of games. And yet, despite both being close last season, neither appears to have a title shot.",
      "PHILADELPHIA 76ERS",
      "Reasons to be optimistic: They have the reigning MVP in Joel Embiid, which is always a good place to start. Tyrese Maxey is on stardom's doorstep. Nick Nurse should add all sorts of levels of creativity to an offense that has often stalled-out in the playoffs.",
      "Reasons to be pessimistic: They're paying $35 million to a player who doesn't want to be there. That's usually not a recipe for success.\u00a0",
      "X-Factor: The Sixers are not going to win a title with James Harden on the roster. The question is if Daryl Morey, the team's president of basketball operations, can turn whatever he gets back in a Harden deal into another star who can help Embiid get over the hump. If not, this could be a lost season.",
      "[Read more: Emotion vs. Analytics: Why James Harden and Daryl Morey were always destined to implode]",
      "MIAMI HEAT",
      "Reasons to be optimistic: As we learned once again last season during the playoffs, don't ever bet against Erik Spoelstra and Jimmy Butler.",
      "Reasons to be pessimistic: Despite last season's playoff success, this was still a team that won just 44 regular season games \u2014 and now they've lost Max Strus and Gabe Vincent. Neither have been replaced. And Butler is a year older.",
      "X-Factor: Who knows what deal the Heat actually offered Portland in exchange for Damian Lillard, and if Tyler Herro was ever a part of a proposal. It doesn't matter anymore. Herro is still in Miami and the only player on this roster who's both young enough and talented enough to make some sort of leap.",

      "It was, of all things, an art contest. The Spurs gave their players a few minutes to sketch The Coyote, the team mascot. Wembanyama thought for a few seconds and went to work. The teenager makes no secret that he loves art and studies it by visiting museums and exhibits. So it should have been no surprise that his drawing topped all others.",
      "\"Since it\u2019s a contest, I gave 100 percent,\" Wembanyama said. \"I wanted to win.\"",

He\u2019s so coordinated for how tall he is, just a very unselfish player, can make any play, and he\u2019s very comfortable shooting from anywhere.

Evidently, Wembanyama \u2014 who was an excellent student \u2014 understands geometry and that the shortest distance between two points is typically a straight line. Perhaps that\u2019s why he decided to dribble through Bullock\u2019s legs in a preseason game against Houston; Bullock was near midcourt, got into a wide defensive stance, his feet probably four feet apart, so Wembanyama knocked the ball through the opening, ran by Bullock and continued his path to the basket without missing a stride.",
      "Wembanyama wasn't showing off; he was just playing the game.",
      "\"I think it\u2019s a move that\u2019s efficient, and I\u2019ve been visualizing it [for] weeks,\" Wembanyama said. \"I\u2019ve been waiting for the occasion to try it. I think I don\u2019t want to limit myself to what\u2019s already been done \u2014 even this has been done \u2014 but I don\u2019t want to limit myself to what\u2019s conventional. I want to expand my game as much as I can, and I think that was a good move, an efficient move.\"",
      "Other moves have been equally good and efficient, without the finesse.",
      "Enter Thomas Bryant. The Miami Heat center is a big man \u2014 6-foot-10, somewhere around 250 pounds, shoulders about as broad as one can find even in the land of giants that is the NBA. The Heat were playing the Spurs earlier this month and Wembanyama received a pass at the edge of the lane. He took one dribble, took off from outside the restricted area that stretches a few feet from the basket and dunked over Bryant with absolute ease. All Bryant could do was stare at the Heat bench, his face in complete disbelief.",
      "\"We\u2019ve seen the footage, we\u2019ve read about him, we\u2019ve heard what everybody said about him,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"But until you actually see it, live, in person, there\u2019s no real way to describe it.\"",
      "Spoelstra is the coach with the second-longest current tenure with his team, behind only Popovich. There is a longstanding friendship between the two, just as there is great respect between the Spurs and Heat \u2014 born in large part from the NBA Finals matchups in 2013 and 2014.",
      "And Spoelstra knows what Wembanyama will be able to do for the 74-year-old Popovich, the all-time winningest coach who probably won't hear questions about retiring anytime soon. They were oft-asked in recent years; then the Spurs got Wembanyama and Popovich signed for five more seasons.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s probably just piquing a great deal of interest,\" Spoelstra said. \"I mean, Pop is the one of the greatest that\u2019s ever done it. He\u2019s coached a lot of different kinds of teams, a lot of different kinds of players. And I think you want to coach guys that are totally unique.\"",
      "That\u2019s what Wembanyama is. The combination of height, reach, skill and smarts has had the NBA drooling for years. The Spurs won 22 games last season \u2014 the third-worst season in franchise history \u2014 and missed the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. But the only win that really mattered came in a hotel ballroom in Chicago, when four ping-pong balls gave the Spurs victory in the draft lottery and the chance to take Wembanyama No. 1 overall.",
      "\"When you add a player with Victor\u2019s abilities, your prospects look better,\" Popovich said.",
      "Wembanyama is the preseason favorite to win NBA rookie of the year \u2014 Oklahoma City\u2019s Chet Holmgren, the likely top challenger, still counts as a rookie because he didn\u2019t play last season \u2014 and the Spurs expect to be much better right away. Popovich is never one for grand preseason predictions, or even not-so-grand ones. He insists the Spurs will keep it simple, letting Wembanyama learn and develop while everyone around him improves as well.",
      "For his part, Wembanyama already seems right at home in Texas. He\u2019s worn cowboy hats. He\u2019s checked out the local art scene. And he\u2019s embraced the fans \u2014 and their expectations \u2014 from the day he arrived in the city. His first big request was breakfast tacos, a delicacy in San Antonio. A bag of them was handed to him when the plane landed, and more were in the Spurs\u2019 facility when he had his first workout there a couple of days later. A simple wish, quickly granted, showed Wembanyama right away what San Antonio can be like.",
      "\"It's been amazing,\" Wembanyama said.",
      "With the season starting next week, it's time to see what Wembanyama and the Spurs \u2014 a franchise with five championships and now set to embark on a quest to start building toward No. 6 \u2014 have drawn up. Ticket demand for his games, home and away, is already intense. He has not seemed bothered by any of the attention, helped by the fact that he went through a similar spotlight as a pro in France the last couple of years.",
      "\"It just makes me want to give everything that these people ask for, and everything they ask is just wins,\" Wembanyama said. \"It just makes me want to give 100% on the court for the franchise and the fan base.\"",

    "paragraphs": [
      "For the second straight week, two popular public plays tumbled in the NFL.",
      "The Buffalo Bills were dealt a surprising upset by the New England Patriots. And the Detroit Lions \u2014 arguably the NFL's hottest team over the last 12 months \u2014 got boat raced by Baltimore.",
      "Those two results helped most bookmakers claim a win in the NFL Week 7 odds market.\u00a0",
      "In addition, bettors took another L in the Week 8 college football odds market.",
      "Let's recap the weekend that was in football betting.",
      "Unpaid Bills",
      "Halfway through the first quarter, Buffalo was already in a 10-0 hole at New England. The Bills, 7.5-point favorites, were down 13-3 at halftime. Midway through the fourth quarter, the Pats got a touchdown to take a 22-10 lead.",
      "But Buffalo rallied with two TDs, adding a two-point conversion after the second score, to take a 25-22 lead with 1:58 remaining. Then Mac Jones led the Patriots to a touchdown in the waning seconds, giving New England a 29-25 upset.",
      "The Bills' loss blew up countless moneyline parlays.",
      "\"No one could imagine a Bills outright loss this morning,\" BetMGM Nevada's Scott Shelton said Sunday night. \"Every parlay/moneyline parlay/teaser bettor had to start over from scratch after the early games.\"",
      "Added John Murray, executive director of The SuperBook: \"The Bills, Raiders and Lions losing were all big.\"",
      "More on those latter two in a moment.\u00a0",
      "Interestingly, South Point sportsbook director Chris Andrews said the Pats' upset didn't help his shop as much as it did others.",
      "\"We had a lot of money on the \u2018dog,\" Andrews said of point-spread play on the Patriots. \"I got flooded with \u2018dog money. We needed the favorite. It wound up OK with the Bills losing [outright]. But if Buffalo would've won and not covered, we would've lost.\"",
      "And that was certainly a possibility when Buffalo went up 25-22. The only thing that gave the South Point a modest win was Bills moneyline parlay action falling apart.",
      "Dousing Detroit",
      "Heading into Week 7, Detroit was 13-3 straight up (SU) and an even-more-torrid 14-2 against the spread (ATS) in its last 16 games. But Baltimore made Detroit look like the Lions of old, rumbling to a 38-6 rout as a 3-point home favorite.",
      "The Lions were very trendy underdogs, with the public firing on the spread and the moneyline.",
      "And although the Raiders-Bears game wasn't glamorous by any stretch, multiple oddsmakers said Chicago's stunning 30-12 victory was another key outcome in their favor. The Bears, 2.5-point underdogs, got there with a virtual unknown at quarterback, rookie Tyson Bagent.",
      "\"The Raiders and Lions were also huge public sides that went down big,\" Shelton said. \"Just when the bettors \u2014 and bookmakers \u2014 think they have these games figured out, days like today leave us shaking our heads. Trying to forecast a game of tackle football is not easy.\"",
      "Andrews' South Point was in the minority on Raiders-Bears, thanks to a significant underdog wager.",
      "\"We took a really big bet on the Bears, $50,000 at +3, and that wasn't the only one,\" Andrews said. \"The Raiders and Bills were our two big [spread] needs, and we lost both.\"",
      "On Campus",
      "On Saturday evening, as No. 14 Utah prepared to take on No. 18 USC, Shelton alluded to the one scenario books are not fond of:",
      "\"The public and the sharps are both on USC,\" he said.",
      "In this instance, though, the public and the sharps took it on the chin. USC, a 7-point favorite, fell 34-32 on a final-seconds Utah field goal.\u00a0",
      "Other key results: No. 10 North Carolina shockingly losing outright 31-27 as a 24-point home favorite vs. Virginia, and No. 5 Washington falling miles short of covering a 28-point spread in its 15-7 home win over Arizona.",
      "Add it up, and it's a rough college football Saturday for bettors.",
      "\"We had our second straight Saturday with good results, after a few weeks of unlucky breaks,\" Shelton said. \"USC and North Carolina losing outright, along with big favorite Washington not covering, were all good for the house.",
      "\"Even Florida State coming back to cover vs. Duke was a good result. We took a lot of late big money on Duke +14.5.\"",
      "Entering the fourth quarter, the fourth-ranked Seminoles trailed No. 16 Duke 20-17. But Florida State scored 21 unanswered points in the final frame to win and cover, 38-20.",
      "I Like Big Bets and I Cannot Lie",
      "Caesars Sports took a few big plays in both the NFL and college. On the pro football front, the Las Vegas Review-Journal's Todd Dewey reported three huge Miami Dolphins bets \u2014 all of which didn't get there in a 31-17 loss at Philadelphia on Sunday night:",
      "\u2013 $242,000 Dolphins moneyline (+140)",
      "\u2013 $136,000 Dolphins moneyline (+135)",
      "\u2013 $158,000 Dolphins +3.5 (-115)",
      "But a $220,000 Eagles -2.5 play cashed, giving the bettor a $200,000 profit and $420,000 total payout.",
      "Other big NFL/college plays:",
      "\u2013 $110,000 Chargers +5.5 vs. Chiefs at Caesars (loss)",
      "\u2013 $33,334 Seahawks moneyline -310 vs. Cardinals at DraftKings. Seattle wins 20-10, bettor profits $10,753, for a $44,087 total payout",
      "\u2013 $25,000 Eagles moneyline -135 at DraftKings. Bettor profits $18,500, for a $43,500 total payout.",
      "\u2013 $135,000 Tennessee +10.5 (-142) vs. Alabama at Caesars (loss)",
      "Then there was this interesting play at DraftKings, on Bills wideout Gabe Davis: $22,222.22 at +220 on anytime touchdown. If the bet had won, the customer's profit would've been $48,888.88, for a total payout of $71,111.10.",
      "Alas, Davis had just one catch for six yards and no touchdowns in Buffalo's 29-25 loss to New England.",
      "And on one of DraftKing's more intriguing prop offerings, a customer put $1,500 at +5000 on all teams to score both a touchdown and a field goal in the 1 p.m. ET Sunday NFL games. A win would've netted $75,000 in profit.",
      "But that wager went begging too, with Detroit, Washington and the New York Giants getting only TDs, no field goals.",
      "All of which is a good reminder to keep it reasonable. Never bet more than you can afford to lose.\u00a0",
      "Enjoy the Niners-Vikings Monday nighter.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 With first place in the NFC South somehow on the line, this was a battle of futility, an absolute clinic in red-zone failure with two teams trying so actively to give the other team the win, and Atlanta escaping with a victory.",
      "Falcons quarterback Desmond Ridder lost three fumbles inside the 12-yard line \u2014 two at the 1-yard line, technically \u2014 but after the Bucs couldn't convert from first-and-goal, tying the game on a field goal with 45 seconds left, he found tight end Kyle Pitts for a 39-yard gain, setting up Younghoe Koo's 51-yard kick as time expired for a 16-13 win at Raymond James Stadium.",
      "Ugly as it was, the win puts the Falcons (4-3) atop the NFC South standings, ahead of the Bucs (3-3) and Saints (3-4) in a division still looking a lot like the one Tampa Bay won at 8-9 a year ago.",
      "\"We certainly like to make it hard on ourselves,\" Falcons coach Arthur Smith said. \"But at the end of the day, we found a way. Situational football, second time in three weeks, found a way at the last second. Koo, like he continues to do, he's clutch. Our guys make plays in big moments. We always feel like we've got a shot, no matter what happens. It's a resilient group.\"",
      "The two teams struggled not just in the red zone, but in goal-to-go situations, going a combined 1-for-7 in converting those for touchdowns. The Falcons went 1-for-5 \u2014 Ridder lost a fumble on a sack at the Bucs' 11 just before halftime, and fumbled a snap from the 1 in the third quarter. The worst mistake came in the fourth quarter, as he scrambled for what looked to be a 12-yard touchdown, only to have Bucs safety Antoine Winfield poke the ball loose inside the 1-yard line, fumbling through the end zone for a touchback.",
      "\"At the end of the day, there's no magical potion to fix fumbles,\" Ridder said after the game. \"It's just strapping up and knowing you have to protect the football. ... For me and everyone else, but obviously me today, we just have to do a better job of that.\"",
      "As bad as Ridder was, the Bucs managed to out-disappoint the Falcons in the closing minutes. In range for a tying field goal and driving for a go-ahead touchdown with fewer than four minutes left, Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield was intercepted by Falcons safety Richie Grant with 3:41 left.",
      "The Bucs defense forced a three-and-out, getting the ball back to the offense, and Mayfield scrambled for a 31-yard gain, leading to a first-and-goal at the 8 with 1:05 left, close to a go-ahead touchdown. Mayfield missed on two passes and was sacked, so the Bucs had to settle for a tying field goal with 45 seconds left, leaving the Falcons a chance to set up a kick of their own.",
      "\"I wanted to close it out when we got down there with a touchdown,\" Mayfield said. \"Once we kicked the field goal and they stopped us, I mean, you're just hoping for overtime.\"",
      "Tampa Bay's defense, which had given up 46-yard passes to Scotty Miller and Tyler Allgeier, had one more mistake left, and Ridder found Pitts for 39 yards to the Bucs' 36. Two plays later, Koo hit the game-winning field goal.",
      "There were frustrations far outside the red zone, to be sure. The Bucs had three holding penalties and three false starts among nine penalties, and the Falcons gave the Bucs six first downs with defensive penalties, one short of their most since 1999.",
      "Atlanta had five drives lead to first-and-goal opportunities and scored only 10 points off of those, keeping the Bucs in the game until literally the final second, so Ridder was well aware of how much easier the win could have been.",
      "\"Obviously, we made it a lot harder on ourselves than we needed it to be,\" he said. \"It's huge to see that through all of that. We can still come out on top, still play as a team. No one pointing fingers, no one blaming anyone, just go out and get a win.\"",
      "[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?\u00a0Create or log in to your FOX Sports account, follow leagues, teams and players to receive a personalized newsletter daily.]",
      "The Falcons won essentially without top rookie Bijan Robinson, who wasn't feeling well before the game and barely played. His only touch came in the final minute, a 3-yard carry on the final drive. Atlanta leaned heavily on Allgeier (21 carries, 59 yards, 53 receiving yards) and Cordarrelle Patterson (10 carries, 56 yards) to carry the offensive load without their leading rusher.",
      "The win puts Atlanta in first place in the division, and the Bucs have to play Thursday at Buffalo, a difficult challenge that could put them further back. The Falcons' next three are against the Titans (2-4), Vikings (2-4) and Cardinals (1-5), which could keep them atop the standings until their next divisional game, Nov. 26 at home against the Saints.",
      "\"It's Week 7, but we'll take it,\" Smith said. \"Road win, division win that puts us 2-0 in the division. We know we've got work to do, but happy to get a win.\"",

    "paragraphs": [
      "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The Miami Dolphins offense has been incredible this season. It's been electric, historic and mostly unstoppable.",
      "And on Sunday night, the Philadelphia Eagles defense was better.",
      "What the Eagles defense did to Mike McDaniels' machine should send a shudder down the backs of offensive coordinators around the NFL. They shut down the Dolphins' high-speed attack, holding them to less than half the yards and points they averaged in the first six games of this season. The Dolphins managed just 244 total yards, had only 12 first downs and their offense scored only 10 points all game long.",
      "That smothering performance by the Eagles defense gave their clearly injured quarterback Jalen Hurts and their struggling offense enough room to get their own act together and pull off an impressive, 31-17 win.",
      "\"One thing about our defense, we just want to go out and attack and be dominant,\" said Eagles corner Darius Slay. \"We knew they were a great run team, a great stretch team. They got all kinds of great stuff going on with that offense. They can do it numerous ways.\u00a0",
      "\"We tried our very best to make them one-dimensional.\"",
      "Not only did they do that, but they made the Dolphins' one remaining dimension barely functional. They held the NFL's best rushing attack to just 45 yards, and the NFL's best passing attack to just 199 yards. That's just not supposed to happen to an offense as fast and dangerous as Miami's. The Dolphins have been producing video game-like stats all season long. They came in averaging 37.2 points per game, 498.7 yards, 316.8 passing yards and 181.8 rushing yards \u2014 all tops in the league. They had a 70-point game earlier this season. They had three games of 500 or more total yards.",
      "That's absurd, but not nearly as absurd as what the Eagles did to them.",
      "\"We made them one-dimensional,\" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. \"That team, I can't tell you how much respect I have for Mike and that staff and those players. I've never seen anybody as fast as Tyreek Hill in person. I mean, damn, he's fast as hell. So great job by our DBs. But it starts with our defensive line and being able to apply pressure, and our DBs did a great job of making (Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa) hold the ball a tick.\"",
      "Tagovailoa was 23 of 32 for 216 yards \u2014 his lowest total of the season. Running back Raheem Mostert ran for only 45 yards. And even though Hill had 11 catches, they went for just 88 yards. The Dolphins averaged five touchdowns per game before Sunday night. Against the Eagles, their offense reached the end zone just once.",
      "That's crazy for a team whose overall speed is unmatched, with such a diverse and creative offense that so many teams have been unable to figure out. But on a night when Hurts (23 of 31 for 279 yards, two touchdowns, one interception) seemed hobbled and even worse a brace on his left knee in the second half, the Eagles defense made things easier for him by pushing down on the Miami offense with relentless penetration and pressure from their front line. They also got some impressive sideline-to-sideline play by edge rusher Haason Reddick, who had two big, early tackles for loss on Mostert that Sirianni thought set the tone for the rest of the game.",
      "In the first half, the Dolphins' offense was virtually non-existent. They had just 113 total yards, including minus-7 on the ground. They couldn't sustain anything until the final two minutes, and even then they needed a dazzling, 29-yard catch by Cedric Wilson Jr. who barely got his feet in bounds on a 3rd-and-18 play to keep that drive alive.",
      "That drive ended with Hill doing what Hill does \u2014 hitting the turbo button on his speed and burning cornerback James Bradberry for a 27-yard touchdown catch. But that was really the end of Hill's impact on the game. Even the Eagles were surprised at how quiet he was.",
      "\"He's electrifying,\" Slay said. \"I honestly think he's the MVP of the league right now. He's a dominant guy. World-class speed. It's hard to guard a guy like that.\u00a0 You've just got to contain him, just basically try to keep a roof over the top of him because he can run right by you. He is the best receiver in the league.\"",
      "And yet, they contained him just like they did everybody else in a Dolphins uniform. Those two big plays at the end of the first half were basically it for Miami. That was the only Dolphins drive that went for more than 45 yards the entire night and the only one that ended in the end zone. Miami's other touchdown was a defensive Pick-6.",
      "Now, the Eagles did get some breaks. Hill dropped a pass in the red zone late in the third quarter when he could've walked in the end zone for a 21-yard touchdown. And on the fourth-down play that followed, Bradberry got away with a blatant facemask on Wilson that caused Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa's pass to fall incomplete. If either one of those plays goes the Dolphins way the entire game could have changed.",
      "But the Eagles had their share of big plays too. They sacked Tagovailoa four times, including two from defensive end Josh Sweat. And Slay had the biggest play of the game when he picked off Tagovailoa at the Eagles 1 (\"That's why they call me \u2018Big Play Slay,'\" he said). The Dolphins quarterback thought he had running back Mostert heading toward the end zone, but he was under pressure and threw off his back foot. That caused his pass to float, which gave Slay time to break off his man and cut in front of Mostert for the interception.",
      "It was impressive, but no more impressive than what the rest of the defense did against an offense that has blazed through everybody they've played.",
      "\"We knew they had a really explosive offense,\" defensive tackle Fletcher Cox. \"Our biggest thing was slowing them down.\"",
      "They did, proving again that the Eagles have many ways to beat anyone they play. They don't need Hurts to be on fire. They don't even need their powerful rushing attack to lead the way. It can be easy to forget sometimes, but after what the Eagles did to the Dolphins on Sunday night it should be clear to everyone: The Eagles have a dangerous defense, too.",

The consistent if not dominant Chiefs hold the top spot, while the Dolphins' loss to the Eagles and the Ravens' thumping of the Lions shakes up the middle of the pack.\u00a0",
      "Meanwhile, the resurgent Jaguars continue to climb, the Cowboys lurk and a gritty new squad enters the rankings.\u00a0",
      "With 49ers-Vikings still on the Week 7 docket, here is my NFL top 10.",
      "1. Kansas City ChiefsRecord: 6-1; Last Week: 1",
      "The Chiefs' winning formula might have changed with their defense playing at an elite level, but the wins keep piling up with Andy Reid's squad excelling at complementary football. Patrick Mahomes & Co. are playing efficiently, utilizing a more conservative approach that features higher-percentage throws to tight end Travis Kelce and an unheralded collection of pass-catchers. With Isiah Pacheco churning out yards on the ground, the Chiefs' methodical approach will make them a tough out in the postseason tournament.",
      "2. San Francisco 49ers\u00a0Record: 5-1; Last Week: 3",
      "The 49ers are the \"Bullies on the Block\" in the NFC due to their overwhelming talent, toughness and physicality. Kyle Shanahan's squad specializes in beating opponents up at the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, and few opponents can withstand the 60 minutes of body blows delivered by San Francisco. Although questions persist as to whether Brock Purdy can lead this team to wins without an elite supporting cast around him, the 49ers' depth will enable the QB1 to continue to thrive utilizing a managerial approach.",
      "3. Philadelphia EaglesRecord: 6-1; Last Week: 4",
      "A dominating performance against the Dolphins Sunday night showcased the team's potential as a title contender. The Eagles' ultra-athletic defense can suffocate opponents with its collective speed, quickness and explosiveness. With a deep and talented collection of blue-chip defenders making plays all over the field, the Eagles can rely on the defense to keep games in play until Jalen Hurts & Co. find their rhythm offensively. As a big-play machine with elite pass-catchers (A.J. Brown, Dallas Goedert and DeVonta Smith) and dynamic runners, the Eagles' high-powered offense perfectly complements a stingy defense that bullies opponents into submission.",
      "4. Miami Dolphins\u00a0Record: 5-2; Last Week: 2",
      "The Dolphins' offensive sorcery is spell-binding but not enough to overcome the team's inconsistent play against the elite teams on their schedule. Though the defense is playing without some injured Pro Bowlers in the secondary, the unit's inability to keep\u00a0the score down forces Mike McDaniel to turn every game into a shootout. Against the top teams, the Dolphins must win each of the three phases (offense, defense and special teams) to chalk up a W, and they are not yet good enough on defense to get the job done at a championship level.",
      "5. Jacksonville JaguarsRecord: 5-2; Last Week: 7",
      "Credit Doug Pederson for whipping the Jaguars into a title contender utilizing back-to-back London games, a home game and a prime-time appearance (Thursday Night Football) to forge their identity and a winning blueprint. After pushing their winning streak to four games due to an opportunistic defense and a balanced offense, the Jaguars are mastering the art of playing complementary football.",
      "6. Baltimore RavensRecord: 5-2; Last Week: 9",
      "The offense finally put it all together in Week 7 with a 38-6 rout of the Lions. Lamar Jackson put on a virtuoso performance that reminded the football world of his All-Pro-caliber talents. The former MVP amassed nearly 400 offensive yards and four scores on a series of pinpoint passes and unscripted plays that showcased his growth as a passer and playmaker. With the QB1 playing like a top-five talent and the defense nearly pitching a shutout against an NFC contender, the Ravens are climbing the charts as one of the top teams in the AFC.",
      "7. Detroit LionsRecord: 5-2; Last Week: 5",
      "After taking a tail-kicking at the hands of an AFC bully, the Lions must regroup and refocus before a primetime game (Monday Night Football against the Las Vegas Raiders)\u00a0ahead of their bye week. While the one-game stinker will kill some of the buzz surrounding Dan Campbell's squad, the Lions are built to last with a top-10 unit on each side of the ball.",
      "8. Dallas Cowboys\u00a0Record: 4-2; Last Week: 6",
      "The Cowboys' big win before their bye week has the team well-positioned to make a run at a top seed in the postseason. Although the offense's red-zone woes and the defense's issues against the run are concerns, Dallas' star power might be enough to help \"America's Team\" reemerge as a title contender by season's end.",
      "9. Cleveland BrownsRecord: 4-2; Last Week: 10",
      "Despite playing without their franchise quarterback for most of Week 7, the Browns added another win to their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 without playing their A-game. While the inconsistent presence of Deshaun Watson is problematic, the team's ability to win with backup QB PJ Walker at the helm speaks volumes about Cleveland's talent and depth. Moreover, the Browns' ability to succeed with their star running back (Nick Chubb) and his backup (Jerome Ford) on the shelf showcases the grittiness that separates this team from others in the AFC.",

      "It is not always pretty, but the Seahawks continue to pile up wins behind a gritty defense and blue-collar offense that punishes opponents with hard-hitting runs and timely play-action passes. Though the Seahawks leave points on the table and allow inferior opponents to hang around, Pete Carroll's squad finds ways to win, and that's all that matters in this league.\u00a0",

      "For the second straight week, two popular public plays tumbled in the NFL.",
      "The Buffalo Bills were dealt a surprising upset by the New England Patriots. And the Detroit Lions \u2014 arguably the NFL's hottest team over the last 12 months \u2014 got boat raced by Baltimore.",
      "Those two results helped most bookmakers claim a win in the NFL Week 7 odds market.\u00a0",
      "In addition, bettors took another L in the Week 8 college football odds market.",
      "Let's recap the weekend that was in football betting.",
      "Unpaid Bills",
      "Halfway through the first quarter, Buffalo was already in a 10-0 hole at New England. The Bills, 7.5-point favorites, were down 13-3 at halftime. Midway through the fourth quarter, the Pats got a touchdown to take a 22-10 lead.",
      "But Buffalo rallied with two TDs, adding a two-point conversion after the second score, to take a 25-22 lead with 1:58 remaining. Then Mac Jones led the Patriots to a touchdown in the waning seconds, giving New England a 29-25 upset.",
      "The Bills' loss blew up countless moneyline parlays.",
      "\"No one could imagine a Bills outright loss this morning,\" BetMGM Nevada's Scott Shelton said Sunday night. \"Every parlay/moneyline parlay/teaser bettor had to start over from scratch after the early games.\"",
      "Added John Murray, executive director of The SuperBook: \"The Bills, Raiders and Lions losing were all big.\"",
      "More on those latter two in a moment.\u00a0",
      "Interestingly, South Point sportsbook director Chris Andrews said the Pats' upset didn't help his shop as much as it did others.",
      "\"We had a lot of money on the \u2018dog,\" Andrews said of point-spread play on the Patriots. \"I got flooded with \u2018dog money. We needed the favorite. It wound up OK with the Bills losing [outright]. But if Buffalo would've won and not covered, we would've lost.\"",
      "And that was certainly a possibility when Buffalo went up 25-22. The only thing that gave the South Point a modest win was Bills moneyline parlay action falling apart.",
      "Dousing Detroit",
      "Heading into Week 7, Detroit was 13-3 straight up (SU) and an even-more-torrid 14-2 against the spread (ATS) in its last 16 games. But Baltimore made Detroit look like the Lions of old, rumbling to a 38-6 rout as a 3-point home favorite.",
      "The Lions were very trendy underdogs, with the public firing on the spread and the moneyline.",
      "And although the Raiders-Bears game wasn't glamorous by any stretch, multiple oddsmakers said Chicago's stunning 30-12 victory was another key outcome in their favor. The Bears, 2.5-point underdogs, got there with a virtual unknown at quarterback, rookie Tyson Bagent.",
      "\"The Raiders and Lions were also huge public sides that went down big,\" Shelton said. \"Just when the bettors \u2014 and bookmakers \u2014 think they have these games figured out, days like today leave us shaking our heads. Trying to forecast a game of tackle football is not easy.\"",
      "Andrews' South Point was in the minority on Raiders-Bears, thanks to a significant underdog wager.",
      "\"We took a really big bet on the Bears, $50,000 at +3, and that wasn't the only one,\" Andrews said. \"The Raiders and Bills were our two big [spread] needs, and we lost both.\"",
      "On Campus",
      "On Saturday evening, as No. 14 Utah prepared to take on No. 18 USC, Shelton alluded to the one scenario books are not fond of:",
      "\"The public and the sharps are both on USC,\" he said.",
      "In this instance, though, the public and the sharps took it on the chin. USC, a 7-point favorite, fell 34-32 on a final-seconds Utah field goal.\u00a0",
      "Other key results: No. 10 North Carolina shockingly losing outright 31-27 as a 24-point home favorite vs. Virginia, and No. 5 Washington falling miles short of covering a 28-point spread in its 15-7 home win over Arizona.",
      "Add it up, and it's a rough college football Saturday for bettors.",
      "\"We had our second straight Saturday with good results, after a few weeks of unlucky breaks,\" Shelton said. \"USC and North Carolina losing outright, along with big favorite Washington not covering, were all good for the house.",
      "\"Even Florida State coming back to cover vs. Duke was a good result. We took a lot of late big money on Duke +14.5.\"",
      "Entering the fourth quarter, the fourth-ranked Seminoles trailed No. 16 Duke 20-17. But Florida State scored 21 unanswered points in the final frame to win and cover, 38-20.",
      "I Like Big Bets and I Cannot Lie",
      "Caesars Sports took a few big plays in both the NFL and college. On the pro football front, the Las Vegas Review-Journal's Todd Dewey reported three huge Miami Dolphins bets \u2014 all of which didn't get there in a 31-17 loss at Philadelphia on Sunday night:",
      "\u2013 $242,000 Dolphins moneyline (+140)",
      "\u2013 $136,000 Dolphins moneyline (+135)",
      "\u2013 $158,000 Dolphins +3.5 (-115)",
      "But a $220,000 Eagles -2.5 play cashed, giving the bettor a $200,000 profit and $420,000 total payout.",
      "Other big NFL/college plays:",
      "\u2013 $110,000 Chargers +5.5 vs. Chiefs at Caesars (loss)",
      "\u2013 $33,334 Seahawks moneyline -310 vs. Cardinals at DraftKings. Seattle wins 20-10, bettor profits $10,753, for a $44,087 total payout",
      "\u2013 $25,000 Eagles moneyline -135 at DraftKings. Bettor profits $18,500, for a $43,500 total payout.",
      "\u2013 $135,000 Tennessee +10.5 (-142) vs. Alabama at Caesars (loss)",
      "Then there was this interesting play at DraftKings, on Bills wideout Gabe Davis: $22,222.22 at +220 on anytime touchdown. If the bet had won, the customer's profit would've been $48,888.88, for a total payout of $71,111.10.",
      "Alas, Davis had just one catch for six yards and no touchdowns in Buffalo's 29-25 loss to New England.",
      "And on one of DraftKing's more intriguing prop offerings, a customer put $1,500 at +5000 on all teams to score both a touchdown and a field goal in the 1 p.m. ET Sunday NFL games. A win would've netted $75,000 in profit.",
      "But that wager went begging too, with Detroit, Washington and the New York Giants getting only TDs, no field goals.",
      "All of which is a good reminder to keep it reasonable. Never bet more than you can afford to lose.\u00a0",
      "Enjoy the Niners-Vikings Monday nighter.",

      "During the \u201cEvermore\u201d part of her\u00a0Eras Tour\u00a0set, Swift took a pause to address the crowd after a presumed present from a fan landed next to her piano. ",
      "\u201cJust because communication means having gentle, healthy boundaries, it really freaks me out when stuff gets thrown on the stage, because if it\u2019s on the stage then a dancer can trip on it,\u201d Swift said via video posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, by\u00a0Taylor Swift Updates. \u201cI love that you brought presents and that is so nice, but just can you please not throw them on the stage. I love you so much.\u201d",
      "The throwing of objects at live music events has become a disturbing trend in recent months. ",
      "In June,\u00a0Bebe Rexha\u00a0was hit in the face by a concertgoer\u2019s phone, which led to a man being arrested and charged with assault. That same month,\u00a0pop singer Ava Max\u00a0was slapped by an audience member.

Don\u2019t throw things. You know?\u201d",
      "Swift just kicked off the South American leg of her record-breaking Eras Tour in Argentina this week, where she played three shows. Sunday night\u2019s concert was originally set to take place on Friday, but was\u00a0delayed due to inclement weather.",
      "During her Saturday show, Swift\u00a0seemingly confirmed\u00a0her rumored romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who flew to Argentina to support her.

      "When Swift released \u201c1989\u201d in 2014, it seemed like she was at her peak. \u201cShake It Off\u201d became a massive hit, the viral \u201cBad Blood\u201d music video featured seemingly every A-lister in Hollywood, and \"1989\" ended up edging out \u201cFrozen\u201d as the most popular album of the year.",

      "This week, Swift posted three photos on her Instagram story featuring handwritten notes.",

      "Fans immediately took to social media to speculate about the meaning behind the cryptic posts from the \u201cMastermind\u201d singer. Theories circulating on X proposed that the handwritten notes Swift posted could be lyrics from the \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d vault tracks.",
      "On TikTok, a user speculated in a video, which has gotten over 600,000 views, that lines like \u201cAquamarine\u201d and \u201cMoonlit swimming pool\u201d could even be bonus song titles.",
      "When the album was released, it was revealed that the notes were in fact lyrics from the vault songs.",
      "The initial \u201c1989\u201d release had an intro that was penned by Swift when she was 24. ",
      "The TV prologue features one handwritten message from Swift, as well as another two-page note typed in all-caps Courier.",
      "\"I was born in 1989, reinvented for The first time in 2014, and a part of me was reclaimed in 2023 wiTh The re-release of This album I love so dearly,\" she writes in the handwritten prologue. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine The magic you would sprinkle on my life for so long.\"",
      "With the lengthier typed message, some fans zeroed in on one paragraph in particular, in which Swift writes, \"If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn\u2019t sensationalize or sexualize that right? I would learn later on that people could and people would.\"",
      "Factions of Swift\u2019s fan base have been known to clash online over speculation that the pop singer may have had romantic relationships with women, like her female friends. Swift herself said in 2019 that she is \u201cnot a part of\u201d the LGBTQ+ community. That hasn't stopped some fans \u2014 who call themselves \u201cGaylors\u201d \u2014\u00a0from overanalyzing all of her lyrics.",
      "Both notes end with \"It's been waiting for you,\" a line from her \"1989\" song \"Welcome To New York.\"",
      "Ahead of the release, Taylor Nation, the official account for Swift\u2019s management team, also shared a \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d album cover generator for fans to re-create the cover with their own photos. Fans posted their personalized covers, including versions featuring pictures of themselves and their pets.",
      "After the album dropped, many Swifties reminisced about reliving 2014 nostalgia in 2023 on posts on X and TikTok.",
      "\"The people who were in high school/older when 1989 came out\u2026. this album literally shaped our teens and 20s and it gets better with time nobody can tell me otherwise,\" one fan said in a X post.",
      "\"Getting to re-live all of our favorite albums with taylor for the second time is something so special to me... these albums are the soundtrack to our lives and it\u2019s so crazy to look back and see how far we have come since their original release,\" another fan posted. ",
      "The reaction to the album online was largely enthusiastic, with many fans praising the vault tracks and the improvement of Swift's more mature vocals on the new version.",
      "However, the track \"Style (Taylor's Version)\" appeared to disappoint some fans.",
      "\"Oh god what is wrong with style tv... i\u2019m so sorry,\" one fan said in a post.",
      "\"STYLE TV WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU,\" said another fan.",
      "Some Swifties attributed this to a difference in the production on \"Style (Taylor\u2019s Version)\", which was not an exact recreation of the original version.",
      "Nonetheless, \"1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\" debuted with a perfect score of 100 on Metacritic. ",

      "After a whirlwind four weeks in theaters, the singer\u2019s Eras Tour concert film has\u00a0shattered records\u00a0and helped the theater industry weather a light release calendar.",
      "Heading into its final weekend, the\u00a0Eras Tour film\u00a0has collected $150 million in domestic receipts and more than $200 million globally. That global haul represents more than 18% of the $1.092 billion total global box office earned since the film was released Oct. 13, according to data from Comscore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a remarkable, one-of-a-kind, record-breaking and influential run for the Eras Tour, not to mention a huge win for Taylor Swift and theater owners,\u201d said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com.",
      "Expectations are that Swift will add another $10 million domestically this weekend and could be the number one film at the box office once again.",
      "So far, the Eras Tour film is the highest-grossing domestic and global concert film release of all time, but lags just behind \u201cMichael Jackson\u2019s This Is It\u201d concert documentary\u2019s global haul of $262.5 million.",
      "Swift\u2019s concert film release came at an opportune time. Labor strikes in Hollywood led a number of films to depart the theatrical calendar, including the much-anticipated \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d from\u00a0Warner Bros. Discovery\u00a0and Legendary Entertainment.",

      "Swift\u2019s unique release, coupled with her decision to distribute the film through the theater chain\u00a0AMC\u00a0instead of a traditional Hollywood studio, has also led to increased speculation about where the concert film will land on streaming.",
      "Currently, it appears that Swift is waiting for the SAG-AFTRA strike to wrap up before negotiating with streamers for the rights to her concert film. The film is much-coveted in the industry and a big bidding battle is expected.",

      "After an already impressive year, NewJeans is reflecting on being the first female group to be nominated for the \u201cTop Billboard Global (Excl. U.S.) Artist\u201d award.\u00a0",
      "The group, which has experienced a swift rise since its debut in 2022, landed the spot in the category alongside artists Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, Bad Bunny and Ed Sheeran. NewJeans also earned the most nominations, spread across four different categories, among this year\u2019s K-pop acts.",
      "The nomination factors in streaming and sales from countries and territories around the world from Canada to Japan but excludes U.S. audiences, according to Billboard. The category was introduced last year. ",
      "The teen quintet \u2014 whose members\u2019 stage names are Minji and Hanni, 19; Danielle, 18; Haerin, 17; and Hyein, 15 \u2014 became a fast fan favorite after they broke out largely unannounced in July of 2022 with their single \u201cAttention.\u201d Now as they break global barriers, they say they aren\u2019t quite convinced about calling themselves K-pop idols or global pop stars \u2014 or whether there needs to be a distinction.",
      "\u201cJust the fact that we\u2019ve been nominated in a category with artists that are greatly loved globally is still very surreal, hard to believe and an absolute honor,\u201d Hanni, who is Vietnamese Australian, told NBC News, referring to their nomination. \u201cRather than defining our music under a certain title or genre, we\u2019re more focused on strengthening a sound personal to NewJeans, and also music that the five of us truly love and enjoy.\u201d",
      "Danielle, who is Korean Australian, also said she wasn\u2019t certain about whether they need to stay in any one lane.",
      "\u201cI believe there are no boundaries or genres in music,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the same context, I don\u2019t think there are distinct boundaries between K-pop artists and global pop stars. I believe that NewJeans is a group that strives to continuously present fresh and new music accessible to all listeners.\u201d",
      "This year, the group became the first K-pop female act to sell more than 1 million copies of a debut album. In August, their sophomore extended play, \u201cGet Up,\u201d hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, just two days after the teens made history as the first K-pop female group to perform at the Chicago-based Lollapalooza festival, which also served as their U.S. live debut.\u00a0",
      "The young women also broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify, surpassing K-pop veterans BTS and Blackpink.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "Jung Min-jae, a South Korean music critic and Korean Music Awards selection committee member, said what makes the group distinct is that they fit the modern Y2K aesthetic \u2014 apt for their age group \u2014 while their music, choreography and vocals don\u2019t rely on maximalist hooks, which are standard in K-pop, but rather smoother flowy arrangements that seemed more organic.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
      "Korean music critics have said that NewJeans is everything contemporary K-pop was not, arriving fresh-faced in a \u201cseemingly unchanging\u201d industry. Jung added that their music was relatively easier for the public to grasp compared to other K-pop songs.",
      "\u201cAfter 2010, K-pop was largely produced in song camps that involved many domestic and foreign composers or songwriters. In turn, there were many songs with complicated and showy sound design, chord progression and organized melody,\u201d Jung explained.\u00a0",
      "\u201cMeanwhile, a lot of NewJeans\u2019 songs are similar to what Korean audiences have commonly heard in the \u201890s and \u201800s, with uncomplicated chords and melodies. \u2026 In this saturated K-pop market, I think choosing easy-listening was a smart approach,\u201d Jung said.\u00a0",
      "The young women pointed out that most of them help write the songs, like \u201cSuper Shy,\u201d \u201cHype Boy,\u201d \u201cDitto\u201d and many other titles that broke into massive hits.\u00a0",
      "\u201cI\u2019m attached to all our songs, but with \u2018Attention,\u2019 it feels like there\u2019s almost a loving, nostalgic sensation stuck to my heart,\u201d said Danielle, who co-wrote their debut song, which brought the girls to recognition. She now has four songwriting credits under her belt and more recently co-composed \u201cCool With You.\u201d \u201cIt feels like the idea of first love. It was like confessing to your friend for the first time.\u201d",
      "Jeff Benjamin, a K-pop columnist at Billboard, attributed their success to their \u201cmusic-first\u201d approach, meaning the group focused on the music rather than relying on manufactured hype, assigning each member a fixed position or generating buzzy teasers under a big label.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
      "\u201cTheir music is also influenced by trends that are popular online, with this Jersey club sound that\u2019s been going viral with different remixes. It\u2019s something that hasn\u2019t been seen in K-pop,\u201d Benjamin said of the electronic and dance-style club music that emerged in Newark in the early 2000s and is more rooted in Baltimore club and Chicago house music.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "Before their overnight success, the young women were largely just kids with big dreams, they said.\u00a0",
      "\u201cI was born in a beautiful, quiet place set a little aside from Sydney, Australia. It was a lovely place with a lake nearby where I have great memories of swimming as a young child,\u201d Danielle said.\u00a0",
      "Music had always been a part of her household, she said. \u201cI first came across K-pop when I stayed briefly in Korea with my family. It was eye-opening, and I fell in love with it.\u201d",
      "While the group debuted a bit over a year ago, on July 22, 2022, Danielle pointed out that they have shared a house since they were K-pop trainees \u2014 a system consisting of practicing exhaustively in vocals, dance and a host of other lessons, often years before a debut. These days, the group practices for about four to five hours before a performance.",
      "\u201cThe trainee years were so much fun, but also came with a lot of introspection,\u201d Danielle said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of process of finding who I am. Am I doing OK? Am I going in the right direction? As you go through these questions and put in consistent effort, there comes a moment where you realize you\u2019ve grown a little.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
      "The group comes from diverse backgrounds, living apart from their families to follow their pursuits. \u201cAll my family are living in Australia, so I talk to them on the phone every day,\u201d Hanni said. \u201cThey\u2019re far away, but they often come to Korea, so I get to see them.\u201d\u00a0",
      "The group faces an industry with pressures to keep up appearances and compete. Despite the demands, they say they try to remain close to their roots.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "\u201cWe have put in a lot of time and effort into practicing, but the music I grew up listening to and loving, I believe, does play a big role in how I perform and sing,\u201d Hanni said. \u201cEspecially with my family and how they loved music also drives me to keep my love for music always sincere and passionate.\u201d",

Kelce\u00a0made a cameo\u00a0on the show, while Swift was on hand to introduce musical guest\u00a0Ice Spice.",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t push him,\u201d Travis Kelce said. \u201cI placed my hand on the gentleman\u2019s back to let him know I was behind him. If I would have pushed him, he probably would have turned around and tased me.\u201d",

      "\u201c\u2019Good sir, can you excuse me? I need to get the door. Sorry. I\u2019m right behind you. I don\u2019t want to startle you. I know it\u2019s your job to keep crazy people away, and if you just randomly get pushed in the back while standing in front of a door, that could probably be a little alarming,\u2019\u201d Travis Kelce continued in a joking tone.",
      "He then said security didn\u2019t talk to him about what happened while complimenting the work they do.",
      "\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t one time get security to say anything about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what \u2014 they\u2019re great. They\u2019re great. They\u2019re good people.\u201d",

      "Kelce had six catches in 58 yards, which game announcers noted was down from previous weeks. ",
      "Just last week, in the Chiefs' game against the Los Angeles Rams, CBS aired a graphic that showed Kelce had some of his best moments of the 2023 season when Swift was cheering him on from the VIP box above. ",
      "CBS Sports aired a version of the same graphic during Sunday's broadcast. With Swift in attendance, Kelce was recording 108 yards. Without her, that number was 46.5. ",
      "On average, Kelce has been making 7.7 catches per game, but Sunday he had only six. More notably, he has been averaging just over 83 receiving yards per game. Sunday, he clocked in at 58 yards. ",
      "He also didn't manage to score any touchdowns against the Broncos; he has scored four this season. ",
      "Kelce's performance was definitely down, although it remains too soon to say it was intrinsically linked to Swift's attendance, as Sunday's showing wasn't abysmal. ",
      "With Swift there, the Chiefs were able to maintain an undefeated record (4-0 when Swift showed up, 2-2 when she skipped out), and Kelce had 432 receiving yards while she was there and only 151 when she wasn't. ",
      "Broncos fans, though, attributed it to Swift's absence, trolling Chiefs fans at Empower Field at Mile High Stadium by playing her music after the team's loss. ",

      "It\u2019s a love story that people just want to say yes to: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce \u2014 who have been rumored to be dating since September \u2014 are inspiring people to step up their own dating expectations.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "While no one knows what their very viral and public relationship is like behind closed doors, many fans \u2014 who have parasocial relationships with Swift \u2014 are rooting for her happiness. Kelce, it seems, is the fairy tale match they hoped she would find.\u00a0",
      "He\u2019s on the sidelines of her Eras Tour show with Swift\u2019s dad, singing along to \u201cBlank Space\u201d and grinning when Swift changes the lyrics to \u201cKarma\u201d to refer to him. He catches her in his arms when she runs to give him a kiss at her show. He praises her on his podcast. Even before the two were romantically linked, Kelce was a fan with a friendship bracelet and a dream.\u00a0",
      "Seeing how Kelce has publicly supported and praised Swift has elevated many people\u2019s own expectations for what they seek in romantic partnerships. Some online say they are making changes in how they approach dating.",
      "\u201cI definitely was dating the worst of the worst of the worst of men, and I thought it was normal. I was begging for phone calls, for just any form of communication,\u201d said Martha Mary Santos, 26, of Mandeville, Louisiana, who made a TikTok video reacting to Swift and Kelce. \u201cWhen I saw the way Travis treats Taylor, it was a massive wake-up call for me.\u201d",
      "Lisa Carr, 32, a TikTok commentator on women\u2019s culture and pop culture, noted the parallels between the popularity of Swift and Kelce\u2019s relationship and this moment in culture. Music charts are dominated by women; the Greta Gerwig-directed \u201cBarbie\u201d movie became a box office phenomenon; Swift\u2019s Eras Tour and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance tour broke records, she said.",
      "\u201cThere is an insane amount of sociological and cultural factors that are captured at this intersection of Travis and Taylor right now,\u201d Carr said in a TikTok video that went viral. \u201cWhat are we kind of saying no to, and yes to, as a society? This has been a loud and resounding yes.\u201d\u00a0",
      "\u201cThe women are winning loudly, and the men have been real quiet,\u201d she added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
      "In an interview, Carr, who is from Tacoma, Washington, elaborated on Swift and Kelce\u2019s relationship. She said their public support of each other \u2014 whether at a football game or on a concert tour \u2014 exemplifies a key facet of healthy relationships: being each other\u2019s biggest cheerleader.\u00a0",
      "Kelce seems to appreciate Swift for exactly who she is, Carr said. Instead of trying to woo her solely with grand but generic gestures, he leans into simple behaviors meant to make his partner feel seen: making her a friendship bracelet, speaking highly of her on his podcast, holding up a \u201cWe Will Stay\u201d sign during her performance of \u201cThe Archer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know a lot of people are like, \u2018Oh, wait till they break up.\u2019 And so what? I actually wish every single one of her ex-boyfriends was like this,\u201d Carr said. \u201cWe shame these sort of expressions of love, of gentleness, of commitment. We underappreciate them in our society. So I just hope that people can really start to expect that from other people.\u201d",
      "For Santos, what stands out about Kelce is that he isn\u2019t feigning detachment to appear cool to other men, nor is he threatened by Swift\u2019s overwhelming success. Instead, he seems openly lovestruck for millions to see.\u00a0",
      "Having recently left a two-year relationship, Santos said watching Swift and Kelce\u2019s romance unfold has extinguished any doubts about whether her breakup was for the best. Now, she said, she has seen the kind of love story that\u2019s possible.",
      "Los Angeles resident Emily Hamocon, 28, also ended a relationship about five months ago. Hamocon, who posts self-love advice on TikTok, said she and many others in the dating pool are tired of being treated as if they are unworthy of being loved out loud.",
      "Kelce \u201cis not afraid to show his emotions, to show his love,\u201d said Hamocon, who also shared her thoughts in a TikTok video. \u201cThat takes a lot of courage, especially since he knows there\u2019s millions and millions of people watching the relationship and he still chooses to show that sensitive side of him, which means he\u2019s definitely very secure in his masculinity.\u201d",
      "Raghav Kalra, 23, who is from New York City, said observing Swift and Kelce\u2019s dynamic has raised his own barometer for finding a partner.\u00a0",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something to be said about the fact that someone is proud to be dating you,\u201d said Kalra, a self-proclaimed Swiftie. \u201cI think what a lot of people like about this relationship, and what they\u2019re looking up to and also expecting going forward, is to just not settle for less.\u201d",
      "Atlanta resident Jess Rose, 36, said Kelce is \u201cthe personification of: \u2018If he wanted to, he would,\u2019\u201d a sentiment many online have echoed.",
      "The phrase has become a popular piece of dating advice in recent years. Though some criticize it as oversimplifying dating \u2014 not everyone can fly 11,000 miles round-trip to spend a weekend with their partners \u2014 many say the point is that someone who cares will put in the effort to show it.",
      "For Rose, watching Kelce demonstrate his commitment reminds her of the green flags she had noticed in her now-husband, who would regularly drive three hours round-trip simply to have lunch with her. (She calls it \u201clove math,\u201d an iteration of terms such as \u201cgirl math\u201d and \u201cboy math,\u201d jokes that trended this year to delineate the whimsical logic behind people\u2019s decisions.)",
      "I hope this is giving women that permission to not lower their standards to be with a successful equal man.\n",
      "-Jess Rose, tiktoker ",
      "\u201cTaylor being with a guy like Travis, who seems to check not only the success bucket, but good to his family, good to his community, confident in his own right, really wanting to be an equal,\u201d said Rose, who also made a TikTok video about the topic, \u201cI hope this is giving women that permission to not lower their standards to be with a successful equal man.\u201d",
      "She said much of the dominant narrative in pop culture has taught women that if they date a successful man, they should accept the relationship as it comes \u2014 even if that means diminishing their own needs to accommodate those of their male partner.",
      "\u201cI have a young daughter, and I like that she can look to our marriage,\u201d Rose said, \u201cbut I also like that this is giving her a relationship in such a public eye of a man who\u2019s really honoring his equal partner and not asking her to change who she is or dim her light for him.\u201d",

      "Because why would the NFL schedule a game in Germany in the middle of the season?",
      "The answer is simple: The league is always looking for more ways to grow, and growing the international audience is a great way to do that. So the NFL has scheduled games in the UK the past few years, and there\u2019s a football-hungry audience in Germany.",

They were undefeated and looked destined for a Super Bowl berth. Better yet, the critics who said Brock Purdy was a system quarterback propped up by a roster of All-Pros and Kyle Shanahan, the NFL\u2019s premier offensive coach, looked incredibly incorrect about their assessment.",
      "Well, about that.",
      "Ever since that Dallas beatdown, San Francisco has lost three straight games. The latest was a humbling 31-17 outclassing at the hands of Joe Burrow\u2019s Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. In the process, San Francisco\u2019s stacked defense has looked anything but vaunted, and as a team, they don\u2019t appear to have an answer for this tailspin. More importantly, Purdy, the same man many decried as an overrated system player, finally looks the part after throwing five picks in three weeks. He resembles the player incapable of leading a contending offense.",

When those two return, it\u2019s likely the 49ers will be world-beaters again. They\u2019re simply too good on paper.",

People who believe (believed?) he was an elite player wanted to erroneously utilize the 49ers\u2019 overall team success as evidence of his being special. OK. Sure. Let\u2019s put on the shoe on the other foot, then. If Purdy was so great when the front-running 49ers were at the top of the NFL\u2019s standings, most of the blame should now lie at his feet, with them scoring 51 total points in a three-game losing streak. He is, in fact, letting the 49ers down and regressing back to the mean. Hard. Because that\u2019s how that works, right?",

That lasted all of four snaps before Rodgers tore his Achilles and was (presumably) lost for the season. The Bills had a 3-0 lead at that point, which grew to 13-3 at halftime \u2014 and Zach Wilson didn\u2019t look he could complete a forward pass.",
      "But Josh Allen\u2019s two second-half interceptions, along with a lost fumble, gave the Jets life and we headed to overtime tied at 16. Buffalo got the ball first, didn\u2019t gain a first down and punted to Xavier Gipson, who returned it 65 yards for a walk-off touchdown to end the game.",

      "The Texas Rangers have survived. Texas absolutely walloped the Astros 11-4 on the road in a win-or-go-home matchup that didn\u2019t feel too tight at all because the Rangers were just\u00a0that\u00a0good.",
      "This Rangers team, man. Look. I promised I wouldn\u2019t call them you-know-what anymore and I plan on keeping that promise. But this team just continues to leave me in awe.",
      "First of all, man. Adolis Garc\u00eda, have yourself a playoff run. That\u2019s your ALCS MVP, folks. His career has been quite the journey \u2014 he\u2019s been DFA\u2019d twice by two separate teams, including these Rangers. Now, he\u2019s forever cemented as a hero in Arlington after hitting five home runs in his last four games to end the series and take care of things on the road.",
      "There\u2019s also Jos\u00e9 Leclerc who has made stand after stand after stand for the Rangers this postseason without wavering much at all. He\u2019s also forever a hero in Arlington, no matter where things go from here.",
      "This feels so special.\u00a0I mean, the Rangers aren\u2019t supposed to be here, right? This is a squad that only won 128 games combined through the last two seasons.",
      "This isn\u2019t the regular path we see teams take to the World Series.\u00a0You know how it typically goes, right? When a team climbs back to the top? First the team stinks. Then it just makes the playoffs \u2014 maybe it sneaks in to the wild card or just plays in a poor division. They get bounced out early in the first year. They might get bounced in the second, too. But, eventually, that team finally opens the door.",
      "Texas said \u201cYeah, no thanks\u201d and absolutely kicked the door in. This is sports at it\u2019s best, man. You absolutely love to see it.",

      "For two straight weeks, the 49ers have been in situations where they\u2019ve needed their quarterback to make big plays for them in clutch situations. To be frank, Brock Purdy has failed to do that twice. He looked awful in the fourth quarter against the Vikings on Monday night.",
      "Purdy threw two fourth-quarter interceptions against Minnesota, including this baffling one that completely sealed the game. Kyle Shanahan\u2019s face says it all.",

      "\u2014 The 49ers were also missing Deebo Samuel and Trent Williams \u2014 two players who make Brock\u2019s job infinitely better.",
      "I\u2019ll be the first one to tell you I\u2019m not the biggest believer in Purdy. But we shouldn\u2019t let this moment write the book on him. There\u2019s plenty more football left to be played.",

      "\u2014 Suns @ Warriors (10:00 p.m. ET)",
      "These are two juicy matchups to start things off. There\u2019s plenty of intrigue with them both.",
      "There\u2019s a Lakers-Nuggets rivalry brewing and I\u2019m so here for it. On the other side, we finally get Kevin Durant\u2019s return to Golden State since leaving all those years ago. I fully expect cheers for him considering everything he accomplished with the Warriors, but there will probably be some boos, too. It\u2019s KD. That goes without saying.",
      "It\u2019s obviously way too early to talk about playoff implications considering that no games have been played yet, but these are four of the teams most people are picking to come out of the West at this point. The tiebreaker implications are very real.",

      "But, y\u2019all. CJ Stroud is breaking record after record after record that rookies are not supposed to be breaking here. Robert Zeglinski has more in his weekly NFL awards column.",
      "\u201cFrom the jump, Stroud has shown glimpses that he\u2019s not only a serviceable starter but also a player with the potential to be one of the faces of the league. The young man isn\u2019t even halfway through his rookie campaign and already has 14 touchdown passes and over 2,200 yards passing. He\u2019s a gunner, a leader who elevates his teammates with his presence. These Texans have no business being 4-4, but Stroud won\u2019t let them fade. As evidenced by his 46-second game-winning touchdown drive, he\u2019s someone who is never shy of a clutch moment, too.",
      "There will likely be more to come, but Stroud\u2019s 470-yard, five-touchdown game against Tampa Bay in a 39-37 win will be remembered as one of the finest quarterback outings all year. \u201c",
      "None of that is hyperbole. He\u2019s on pace to at least challenge Justin Herbert\u2019s rookie record for passing touchdowns (31) and Andrew Luck\u2019s record for passing yards (4,374).",
      "The dude is out here making insane throws like this one with 14 seconds left on the clock, setting up another touchdown with six seconds to go in the game.",
      "This throw and catch to set up the game-winning touchdown.",
