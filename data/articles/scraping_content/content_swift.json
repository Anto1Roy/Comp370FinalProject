They're also not too long (as a 5'3 person, I'm all too familiar with pants dragging the ground) so I can wear them with all of my shoes \u2014 they look super cute rolled up a little at the bottom too if needed!

I'm a big fan of Taylor (obviously) but was really enamored by how beautiful the pages are. I was so excited to read this lil' biography with my son and teach him a little more about someone I adore. (Which it does a great job of doing in a pared-down way!) It's a short book, looks cute on my desk, and is a hit for bedtime story time. What more could you want???\""

      "Hundreds \u2014 including veteran news journalists and a White House beat reporter \u2014 applied for the role, Michael Anastasi, Gannett\u2019s vice president of local news, told Variety. The application sought a journalist who could \u201ccapture the music and cultural impact of Taylor Swift.\u201d It was posted as Swift continues to dominate headlines \u2014 from coverage of her widely successful Eras Tour (and subsequent concert movie) to recent buzz around her reported relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018Taylor Swift Reporter\u2019 role probably should have been filled by someone whose focus was the music industry (with a strong knowledge of Taylor Swift) and not a massive Swiftie who happens to be a reporter,\u201d a person posted to X.\u00a0",
      "\u201cone of the main components of taylor swift\u2019s whole brand/ personality is the fact that she is able to perfectly put into words the experience of womanhood\u2026 so who was the genius who decided to give a man this job???\u00a0 (especially a man who can\u2019t even name her songs correctly),\u201d a person posted to X, referring to how, in Variety's story, had West had called one of Swift\u2019s songs \u201cIt\u2019s Good to Have a Friend,\u201d rather than its correct title, which is \u201cIt\u2019s Nice to Have a Friend.\u201d ",

You know, it\u2019s not unprecedented to have somebody (dedicated to covering) someone who\u2019s a Senate candidate, or an athlete, like when LeBron James goes to Miami and has people just covering him. So I think there\u2019s precedent for it. But also, I think, we\u2019re taking a pretty bold step here, and I\u2019m very optimistic for how it\u2019s going to turn out.\u201d"

      "\u201cI would say this position\u2019s no different than being a sports journalist who\u2019s a fan of the home team,\u201d says West. \u201cI just came from Phoenix, and all of the anchors there were wearing Diamondbacks gear; they want the Diamondbacks to win. I\u2019m just a fan of Taylor and I have followed her her whole career, but I also have that journalistic background: going to Northwestern, winning awards, working in newsrooms across the nation. I think that\u2019s the fun of this job is that, yeah, you can talk Easter eggs, but it really is more of the seriousness, like the impact that she has on society and business and music.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do think our biggest moment of contention is gonna be the secret Vault songs,\u201d he said within the first minute of the call \u2014 referring to the bonus tracks on the current blockbuster \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d \u2014 \u201cbecause I know you\u2019re a fan of \u2018Now That We Don\u2019t Talk,\u2019 and I\u2019m a huge fan of \u2018Say Don\u2019t Go.\u2019\u201d West even was able to cite a singular moment in \u201cSay Don\u2019t Go\u201d that makes it the most haunting of the new songs for him: \u201cWhen you listen to it, she screams a harmony of \u2018I said \u201cI love you\u201d\u2018 [in a bridge near the end of the track], and that\u2019s why I really like it: It\u2019s the harmony she screams that\u2019s muted.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were very pleased with the caliber of the pool that we had,\u201d Anastasi says. \u201cI think if we ended up hiring five more people, we would have highly qualified candidates\u201d for all the positions. \u201cIt ran the gamut from veteran hard-news reporters, including at least one very established White House reporter, to Swifties who have blogs and are influencers \u2026 and of course there were a number of fans who just were following their dreams and hoping to win the lottery. But what we ended up with was someone who I think has the great balance between being a veteran journalist who has serious news chops and someone who understands everything about Taylor\u2019s world and the universe that he\u2019s stepping into.\u201d",
      "Adds Ben Goad, the Tennessean news director who will serve as West\u2019s direct boss, \u201cThis is not a traditional \u2018we\u2019re going to write three print stories a week and draw a paycheck\u2019 type of beat. He\u2019s going to be on video, going to be on social, going to be interacting with Swifties, and going to be out and about at tour stops, on red carpets, at the CMAs, wherever people are enjoying or reflecting on who Taylor Swift is. There\u2019s no shortage of things to write.

      "West confirms that he is going to be out and about at CMA Awards-related red carpets in Nashville as part of his first week on the job. But if his job is covering just Swift, does that mean he\u2019ll be asking country stars what their favorite Vault track on \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d is? He\u2019s not tipping his hand, there.",
      "\u201cThe newscasters would make fun of me, saying things like, \u2018We\u2019re surprised Bryan didn\u2019t call in sick to work today because Taylor released a new album.\u2019 I put those (jibes) together, sent it to her team, and said, \u2018Hey, just so you know, Taylor\u2019s got a local news reporter that\u2019s a fan. Tree (Paine, Swift\u2019s publicist) wrote me the morning of the concert and said, \u2018Taylor wants to meet you. How soon can you get out here?\u2019 I went home, I changed, I went to Walgreens and printed out a headshot of me and signed it \u2018from your favorite local news reporter,\u2019 and I sat in the parking lot for four hours until she said, \u2018Hey, your passes to go backstage are at will-call.\u2019\u201d (In his video resume, West recalls the moment and quips, \u201cOur ears touched and I thought for a second, I could be straight.\u201d)",
      "He\u2019s not worried taking on his shift as Swift\u2019s seemingly biggest year draws to a close and 2024 has her largely overseas. Besides covering how the Eras Tour might have different wrinkles in global markets, he\u2019s particularly excited about the expected release of a \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d of \u201cReputation,\u201d which he quite correctly and objectively identifies as one of her best albums.",
      "\u201cI was at a crossroads where I felt like I could live in this darkness or I could wake up and try and be a better person,\u201d West says, \u201cso part of that for me was stepping back from news. I joined a local CrossFit gym that works with people in sobriety and recovery. And then I started working for a company where I traveled the U.S. working with high school student leaders \u2014 and I loved that because I could geek out and I want to be known for being a good person. And that was me stepping back from news. \u2026 And I told them, jokingly, \u2018If I could report on Taylor Swift every day.\u2019 So it almost felt like a manifestation when that same colleague texted me and said, Hey, your dream job just became available.\u2019\u201d"

      "With the release of \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d her fourth re-recorded album, Taylor Swift has never been bigger. What started as a seeming passion project to reclaim her life\u2019s work has catapulted the 33-year-old pop artist to be the biggest living musician in the world no matter how you slice it: sales, streams, concert ticket sales, and even the box office.",
      "The newest version of \u201c1989 TV,\u201d released at the end of October,\u00a0sold 1.65 million copies in its first week, according to Luminate Data, making it Swift\u2019s third album to surpass 1 million sales in the past year and the fifth best-selling week for an album since Luminate began tracking sales in 1991. More surprising: In an era when no one buys music, it outsold the first week of even the original \u201c1989,\u201d considered the first apex of Swift\u2019s career. It also dwarfs the success of her other Taylor\u2019s Versions re-records\u2014\u201dFearless,\u201d \u201cRed,\u201d and \u201cSpeak Now\u201d\u2014which rocked the industry on their own.",

      "All of that is bad news for Shamrock Capital Advisors, the investment firm that bought the masters to Swift\u2019s first six albums from music executive Scooter Braun\u2019s Ithaca Holdings back in 2020. Shamrock will benefit from the uptick in streams of the original versions of her songs that predictably accompany each re-release. But thanks to her songwriting credits on every song in her catalogue, Swift has been able to block other media\u2014including movies and TV shows\u2014from incorporating them into their productions. Radio stations and streaming platforms have also sworn their fealty to the artist, pledging to put the Taylor\u2019s Versions onto playlists and on air, further devaluing the original recordings. ",
      "Also playing into Swift\u2019s success? Fans falling back in love with vinyl (and the pop star offering plenty of vinyl options to purchase). \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d sold 693,000 vinyl copies in its first week, a record for the modern era. The re-release is Swift\u2019s largest traditional sales week of all time."

      "When Taylor Swift announced in 2019 that she would be re-recording her first six albums in an effort to reclaim her original music, fans began eagerly anticipating the opportunity to revisit the past\u2014and hear beloved songs in a new light. But Swift provided even more than that: In addition to re-releasing the tracks off the albums, she also included songs that almost made the cut. The songs, referred to as \u201cFrom the Vault,\u201d feature collaborations with artists Swift has long admired, like Keith Urban, Chris Stapleton, and Phoebe Bridgers. ",
      "Off the Fearless vault, \u201cDon\u2019t You\u201d attempts to capture the messiness of being flooded with conflicting feelings when you unexpectedly run into an ex. While those are all hallmarks of a great Taylor Swift song, \u201cDon\u2019t You\u201d is missing the cutting specificities of the anger, longing, and pretending that come up in those moments that she\u2019s so well-known for. \u201cSo I walk outta here tonight, try to go on with my life. And you can say we\u2019re still friends\u201d comes pretty close, but is just a few drafts away from being totally devastating.\u2014Annabel Gutterman ",
      "There are unfounded rumors propagated by the Swifities that the title track, \u201cSpeak Now\u201d was inspired by Paramore\u2019s front-woman Hayley Williams, who is said to have attended the wedding of her ex-bandmate and ex-boyfriend, Josh Farro in 2010. Taylor Swift and Williams have both spoken about their friendship at length over the years and Paramore is serving as an opening act for more shows of the Eras Tour in 2024, so it was high time the pair find a reason to blend their voices together on a song. The lyrics of the song can be interpreted to be about the failing of relationships, burning those bridges and the metaphorical castle of a partnership being destroyed. Or, it could be about the undoing of a seemingly-perfect reputation\u2014which Swift dealt with after her falling out with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and Williams after Paramore\u2019s bassist Jeremy Davis sued the band and left.\u2014M.M. ",
      "\u201cGot a feelin\u2019 your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life\u201d\u2014that\u2019s a line that belongs on the soundtracks of nearly every early 2010s YA novel turned film adaptation. This is Taylor Swift bringing the drama and describing, in earnest, what it\u2019s like to really need someone, and need them right now. Sure, the idea of an \u201celectric touch\u201d is kind of silly, but this song is a bop!\u2014A.G. ",
      "The second vault track from 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) depicts yet another bruising heartbreak, this time focusing on the pain of watching someone you love walk away, and still wanting them even when they didn\u2019t choose you. And while the lyrics are devastating, the emotional core of the song comes from a fleeting moment of anger in the bridge when Swift screams: \u201cI said I love you. You say nothin\u2019 back.\u201d More of that rage, please!\u2014A.G.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "This empowering song sees Swift reclaiming a word that has been hurled at her for years. In a letter accompanying the physical copies of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), Swift writes that she had become a \u201ctarget for slut shaming\u201d and it started to take a toll on her. To get through it, she turned to writing\u2014and this shimmering feminist anthem was born.\u2013M.M.",
      "I love when Taylor Swift writes songs about other girls, particularly her friends. Ever the great observer, here, Swift sings about a girl named Emma as she grows head over heels for someone. \u201cWhen Emma falls in love, it's all on her face, hangs in the air like stars in outer space,\u201d Swift croons over a wistful melody both in amazement and yearning. One can only hope to have as much main character energy as Emma. Plus, it\u2019s oddly reminiscent of my favorite karaoke song \u201cDrops of Jupiter.\u201d What more could anyone ask for?\u2014Rachel Sonis ",
      "\"Better Man\" isn\u2019t just one of the best vault tracks\u2014it\u2019s one of Taylor Swift\u2019s best songs. Swift perfectly captures the nuance, confusion, and heartache of loving someone even when you know they\u2019re bad for you. The bridge (\u201cI hold onto this pride because, these days, it's all I have. And I gave to you my best. And we both know you can't say that\u201d) stings. Swift doesn\u2019t deviate much from Little Big Town\u2019s 2016 version, but her grown-up vocals help her stick the landing. The only downside is that this was left off Red in the first place.\u2014S.C. ",
      "No one captures the pain ofa woman scorned better than Taylor Swift. But this song is the perfect example of missing that person you once had and knowing that you deserve better because your differences are too big. Add in Chris Stapleton\u2019s gruff, billowing vocals and you have a masterpiece dedicated to moving on. Swift knows how to pick a collaborator whose emotionality doesn\u2019t overpower hers and the duo create a song that\u2019s not about revenge, but is rather a stinging ditty dedicated to not compromising oneself for a partner.\u2013M.M. ",
      "Forbidden love is electrifying and scary at the same time and Swift was able to capture those feelings perfectly in this vault track. The plucky guitars along with the production helped form a mysterious sonic landscape, complemented by a music video that starred Joey King, Taylor Lautner, Presley Cash, and Swift in a heist scenario. It\u2019s a fun pop song that would have done well if it had made its way onto the original tracklist, but we\u2019re still grateful to have gotten it over a decade later.\u2013M.M. ",
      "No one can write a break-up song like Taylor Swift, and \u201cMr. Perfectly Fine,\u201d which should have been on Fearless, proves it. This is Swift at her best, enraged, snarky, and not for a moment taking herself too seriously: \u201cAnd I never got past what you put me through, but it\u2019s wonderful to see that it never phased you!\u201d Rumored to be about her ex Joe Jonas, the track encapsulates the album it was almost on\u2014it\u2019s a fearless takedown of a man who did his woman very wrong. Plus, there\u2019s the mention of \u201ccasually cruel,\u201d which Swift pockets to use later on \u201cAll Too Well.\u201d\u2014A.G. "

      "1989 cemented Swift\u2019s place as not only an artist with longevity, but a star who would make music on her own terms. Nine years later, she is re-releasing this game-changing work once again, as part of her project of recording \u201cTaylor\u2019s Versions\u201d of her discography. The reason? Ownership. After her first six albums were sold against her will four years ago, Swift decided to reclaim her masters by re-recording her albums. This trip down memory lane has proved fruitful, allowing her to revisit her hits, retool certain lyrics, share additional unreleased songs, and draw attention to the breadth of her oeuvre, and not just the most recent output. She\u2019s continued to re-release albums during her record-breaking 2023 Eras stadium tour and the release of the blockbuster Eras movie in mid-October. This late-autumn delivery of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) isn\u2019t so much a rehashing of the past as a return to the memory of why\u2014and how\u2014Swift established herself in the pop firmament nearly a decade ago. Even Swift recognizes it as a turning point, both artistically and personally: \u201cI look at this album,\u201d she said at the time to Billboard, \u201cas me starting over.\u201d",
      "It was a prescient statement. And this ethos has driven her album rereleases: her storytelling, on her terms, in the light of the lessons she\u2019s learned. Each rerelease stays true to the colorful spirit of the past, but comes shaded with the wisdom of hindsight. Isn\u2019t that how we should all approach our memories, and the stories of our lives? The new 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) could never surprise me in the way that first, exciting thrum of \u201cWelcome to New York\u201d did. Yet it\u2019s a reminder that in the quest for living your truth, reinvention is not only possible, but necessary. \u201cThe lights are so bright,\u201d she sang on that seminal song. \u201cBut they never blind me.\u201d The path to self-actualization, it turns out, needed her illumination."

Who says the monoculture is dead? Fan or no, everyone has an opinion, an experience, a story to share, even if it\u2019s grumbling that you can\u2019t watch a football game these days without her performing celebratory chest-bump choreography, which sounds a lot like grouchy cinephiles blaming Marvel for \u201cruining movies.\u201d"

      "In August, fans in the Philippines chanted \"Taylor Swift\" at Reaves as he promoted his signature Rigorer shoe in Manila. By the end of the summer, Reaves was asked to address \u2014 and denied \u2014 the rumor on multiple podcasts, including Showtime's \"All the Smoke\" with former NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson, as well as ESPN's \"The Lowe Post.\" Even Reaves' own teammates texted him about it.\u00a0",
      "Ahead of Lakers Media Day, general manager Rob Pelinka praised Reaves for \"not getting caught up in media rumors about who he's dating.\" And after Sunday's preseason game against Milwaukee, Lakers coach Darvin Ham cracked a joke about Reaves' humility, saying, completely unprovoked, \"He's not afraid to tell Taylor Swift, \u2018No.'\"",
      "He posted side-by-side photos of Swift and Reaves to his Twitter account, RefrigeratorLAL, writing, \"Following her breakup, Taylor Swift was reportedly seen in an Arkansas Bar this weekend with star Laker basketball player Austin Reaves.\"",
      "\"Austin is the trending boy, like the Lakers' darling of the summer,\" he said, explaining his choice of Reaves. \"He just signed this [four-year, $54 million] deal. He's going to Team USA.

      "On that drive, coach Shane Steichen called Taylor's number incessantly. The former All-Pro running back touched the ball on seven straight plays \u2014 six carries, plus a 20-yard screen pass \u2014 en route to his five-yard touchdown run. That possession was the biggest highlight in what was by far Taylor's best performance of the season: 120 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown. He had 18 carries for 75 yards (4.2 yards per carry) and three receptions on four targets for 45 yards (15 yards per catch).\u00a0",
      "The performance showed the NFL world that Taylor is getting back to his pre-injury self. We saw spurts of his impressive cutback ability and second-gear speed.\u00a0",
      "With arguably the best backup running back in the league in Zack Moss, the Colts have the luxury of easing Taylor back in after he missed all of training camp and was out the first four games of the season on PUP. But with the way Taylor played in Week 7, it might be time to let him loose. It might be time to let him carry the Colts as he did in 2021, when he was the league's triple-crown rushing champion.\u00a0",
      "Against the Browns, Taylor split offensive snaps 50-50 with Moss. That was up from 42% the previous week and 15% two weeks ago, when he made his season debut. \u2014Ben Arthur\u00a0"

    "paragraphs": [
      "There is no controversy about the quarterbacks in New York. When Daniel Jones is healthy, the New York Giants are still his team. Nothing Tyrod Taylor has done the past two games has likely changed that.",
      "But that also doesn't change the inconvenient truth for the Giants that Taylor, their veteran backup, performed better on Sunday than Jones had in most of his five starts this season. And the Giants offense, while only marginally more productive, looked much better with Taylor in charge.",
      "Taylor was efficient and careful with the football. His quick decisions helped out the struggling offensive line. And at least in the first half of the Giants' 14-7 win over the Washington Commanders, New York's offense moved far more smoothly than it has for most of the year.",
      "That's not because Taylor, a 34-year-old journeyman, is better than Jones. It's not a sign that he gives the Giants a better chance to win. And it's definitely not a reason for the Giants to make a quarterback change less than eight months and half a season after signing the 26-year-old Jones to a four-year, $160 million contract.",
      "Though to be fair, when asked after the game if Taylor had done enough to remain the starter even when Jones (neck) is finally cleared for contact, Giants coach Brian Daboll didn't exactly say no.",
      "While that non-answer was perfect fodder for the talk-radio shows and tabloids, it's almost certainly not an indication that any change is coming. Still, Taylor's \"good game\" is a chance to learn, even for Jones, to see why he was so relatively successful running the offense. Taylor was 18 for 29 for 279 yards and two touchdowns, and the Giants had 356 yards of offense \u2014 their second-highest total of the season and highest in the last five games.\u00a0",
      "Some of it was situational. Some was circumstantial. Some of it was because of things Taylor did. But it's still worth looking at what went right and what factors contributed to Taylor's success, and whether any of it can help Jones when he returns:",
      "Quick passes/decisions: In the first half, at least, Taylor looked extremely decisive, and it appeared the offensive game plan was designed for him to get the ball out quickly. That makes sense, given how good the Commanders' defensive line is. It remains the best way to counteract a pass rush. It also allows the offensive playmakers to do the work. And a big sign of that focus was how effective tight end Darren Waller was in this game \u2014 his best as a Giant, with seven catches for 98 yards and a touchdown. He's such a big target he should always be the quarterback's best friend when they need to get the ball out fast.",
      "Taylor looked more comfortable in a collapsing pocket: There are no stats to gauge this, but compared to the way Jones looked so jittery over the past few weeks, it was hard not to see how calm Taylor appeared. He was able to stand more in the pocket and get throws out under pressure. And when he had to escape trouble, he wasn't just running away in a panic. He made several terrific, off-schedule throws when he was flushed out of the pocket and found a receiver on the run. Of course, given the beating Jones has taken \u2014 28 sacks in his five starts \u2014 it's easy to see why he had lost his comfort level. Taylor didn't come with that baggage. And he reminded everyone how important that is.",
      "More deep throws: Taylor completed two passes for 75 yards to speedy rookie Jalin Hyatt and targeted him five times \u2014 the most the 22-year-old receiver been targeted in a game this season. In fact, in Taylor's two starts, he's thrown in Hyatt's direction nine times. Jones only threw to him five times in the first five games. So it's about time the Giants made him a big part of their offense. Taylor rightfully called him \"one of the fastest guys on the field, if not the fastest at any given point.\"\u00a0It's true that Jones had been under so much pressure in the pocket in general that the idea of waiting for Hyatt's deep routes to develop seemed like a fantasy. But as Taylor noted, there is value sometimes in just throwing it up quickly and letting the kid see if he can catch up to the ball and make a play. Speed can kill in this game. It also can soften up the defense and open up more of the mid-range routes. That's what it did against Washington's struggling secondary, which made it easier for Taylor to find open receivers all over the field.",
      "The return of Saquon Barkley: Don't underestimate this. In Taylor's two starts, Barkley has rushed 45 times for 170 yards. In the previous three games, with Jones at quarterback and Barkley out, the running backs combined for 47 carries for 107 yards. Without Barkley, the Giants were completely one-dimensional. Defenses didn't respect the Giants' rushing attack and they found it easier to close off Jones' running lanes too. With Barkley on the field, it changes their approach. They have to commit more defenders to the line of scrimmage. That leaves fewer players to cover and gives a quarterback more options when he throws. Barkley doesn't even have to be good to have an impact. He just has to be there.",
      "The offensive line was better: Don't get the wrong idea. The Giants' offensive line still isn't good. But it has stabilized a bit the past two games, and Taylor had a decent amount of time on Sunday against a strong Commanders front. It's hard to know why. Justin \"Straight off the couch\" Pugh had his issues at left tackle with Chase Young, and Tyre Phillips wasn't perfect at right tackle either. Veteran guard Mark Glowinski has definitely played better since his return to the lineup. But they are still missing three starters \u2014 left tackle Andrew Thomas, center John Michael Schmitz and right tackle Evan Neal. The why doesn't really matter, though. A better performance from the line makes all the difference in the world for a quarterback. And their performance was enough to help Taylor. That's a luxury Jones didn't have.",
      "Don't forget, though, that even with all that going right the Giants' offense is still somewhat dysfunctional. For all the praise Taylor is getting, the Giants are still only averaging 11.5 points per game during his two starts \u2014 almost a full point less than they were averaging under Jones (12.4). But the offense is undoubtedly moving better. Under Jones, the Giants averaged just 255.2 yards per game. In two starts for Taylor, they've averaged 336.",
      "What Taylor's success does, though, is give them a window into what a semi-functional offense looks like. And it gives them a roadmap for finding ways to help Jones have a little of that same success."
